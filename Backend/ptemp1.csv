<p>Confused by all the advice on starting a private practice? I’d love to help. I put together a <a href=""https://www.practiceofthepractice.com/start"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">checklist of the top 28 things to do to launch a private practice</a>.</p>
<h1><span class=""s1"">In This Podcast</span></h1>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>If you are in private practice and are under the $60 000 mark, this podcast series is for you! Joe is going back to the basics and running through the various phases involved in setting up a practice that is going to thrive! In this episode, Joe speaks about how to create a marketing plan.</p>
<h3>How To Create a Marketing Plan</h3>
<p>Make sure to maintain a bigger vision when it comes to your marketing plan. Decide where you want your practice to go and how individual decisions will influence that. Structure your marketing plan over the next 12 months and break it up per quarter.</p>
<p>Start with what you want to achieve, i.e.: ideal income, etc., by the end of the year and work backwards from there. Set up KPIs (key performance indicators) for each quarter. Once you know what you need to achieve every quarter, break it down even further to goals per month and then per week.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Learn to evaluate your overall use of time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

We educate the public about the real threat to women’s healthcare posed by anti-choice legislation and policies. We mobilize pro-choice Ohioans to take political action to defend reproductive rights. And we are the voice for Ohio’s abortion clinics, helping them navigate the increasingly hostile climate created by extremist groups. <strong>But we need your help.</strong> As a member organization, we rely on your financial support to fund our important legislative, educational, and grassroots activities.</p>

<br />
<br />
Talking with Jan Koch was one of those interviews that seems like it should have happened much, much sooner.<br />
<br />
I've been following Jan Koch for a few years on social media, we have quite a few mutual friendships and for one reason or another, we simply hadn't connected sooner. I'm so glad we finally made this interview happen. AND... I'm going to go ahead and give a little bit of a prediction here and I think we're going to be hearing a lot more from Jan as an authority/influencer. But that's just my two cents. ;-) . Connecting with Jan (finally), has been a perfect example of the power of relationships. Since having this conversation Jan has connected me with someone who you'll be hearing more from (hint: he has a SaaS product you're ALL going to want to use), I've signed up for the Virtual Summit Mastery (probably one of the best courses I've ever purchased) through Jan's recommendation and link and feel like we're just getting started.<br />
<br />
I had a ton of fun talking with Jan (I know, I know... I say that all the time. But it's true, I love having these conversations) and think you're going to get a ton from this interview (as well as the discount Jan has offered to my listeners for his amazing wooden watches! But you'll have to listen to the interview to find out what that's all about).<br />
Questions I Asked Jan<br />
<br />
 	* Can you share your background with the audience?<br />
 	* When did you launch WP Mastery?<br />
 	* What made you decide to launch WP Summit?<br />
 	* I love that your focus is on building business platforms with WordPress. What made you decide to choose this niche?<br />
 	* Let's talk about your e-commerce business, Little Oak (unique wooden watches). What's the story behind launching a line of watches?<br />
 	* How are you marketing Little Oak?<br />
 	* Do you have any recommendations for someone who wants to start a physical products business?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What You're Going to Learn<br />
<br />
 	* Why Jan dropped out of his Master's program<br />
 	* What he learned running a virtual summit<br />
 	* What the virtual summit did for his business<br />
 	* The type of work his agency does (his agency business is a German website and focuses on German businesses)<br />
 	* Why he uses WooCommerce to run his e-commerce store (he started on Shopify)<br />
 	* How you should validate the need for your product before jumping into E-Commerce<br />
 	* Why you should set aside a reasonable budget for testing<br />
<br />

I decided to begin a podcast about Social Work Research, as I was keen to find out more about all the great social work projects out there in our communities, as well as find out how social work research actually works and what makes it social worky…

Each episode I interview a social work researcher and ask them a few questions about a social work research project they’ve undertaken. Hopefully over the course of a few episodes we can begin to paint a picture of what social work research is and how it makes a difference!

<p>Hi Listeners,</p>
<p>This is the first part of my conversation with Dr Fran Gale and Dr Michel Edenborough from Western Sydney University.</p>
<p>Fran and Michel have been working on a fantastic social research project involving &#8216;digital mapping&#8217; in the Blacktown (Greater Western Sydney) local government area with children and young people.</p>
<p>In this episode you&#8217;ll hear about what it&#8217;s like working on a social work research team, as well as explore further the term methodology in social research, among other things. Keep an ear out for Fran &amp; Michel&#8217;s description of their project &#8211; you&#8217;ll be able to hear the joy and passion in their voices!</p>
<p>Part 2 of the conversation will be following shortly. I hope you enjoy! Tweet me <a href='https://swdiscoveries.wordpress.com/mentions/swdiscoveries/' class='mention'><span class='mentions-prefix'>@</span>swdiscoveries</a> if you have any questions or just want to say hello. Cheers!</p>

I know when I go to conferences, sometimes they want to do add me to a Slack group for everyone at the conference. It&#8217;s fun for the first day, and then it becomes a distraction from the other stuff I do in Slack. It doesn&#8217;t really work for me. Other times, they create their own app and I forget to go check their app or it&#8217;s not written very well. 
They&#8217;re trying to connect with the people at the event, send updates, last-minute issues or changes, and also allow attendees to get to know each other. Slack doesn&#8217;t really work for that. Facebook doesn&#8217;t really work for that. There hasn&#8217;t really been a product that works. Today&#8217;s guest said, &#8220;How about if we create something better?&#8221; And she did.

It allows you to reach your community members via email, if that&#8217;s how they prefer, text if that&#8217;s how they prefer.

Basically they’re using it to reveal how much they can be sold for, now and in the future, and how much their friends can be sold for.”</p> <p>That was an almost accidental lesson she learned during research on how social networks were structuring, or restructuring, friendships, she explains to interviewer David Edmonds in this Social Science Bites podcast. After receiving a monstrous data dump – with permission – of individual’s social media usage, Skeggs and her colleagues were “completely diverted”  as it dawned on them that Facebook was trawling its users’ habits to collect information on people’s general browsing habits.</p> <p>The potentially disturbing but legal practice was only the first step in Facebook’s efforts to monetize social media – and in what Skeggs argues calcifies inequality.</p> <p>“They probably have the greatest capacity to experiment with social data to see who we’re communicating with, how we’re communicating with them,” Skeggs says, “but basically 90 percent of Facebook profit is made from advertising -- selling your data to advertising companies so that they can place an advert on your browser.” And in turn, algorithmically segregating web denizens – well, their composite data profiles, at any rate -- based on their perceived wealth and influence. This “subprime silo-ing” pushes sketchy advertising, in particular for high-interest loans, at people who can least afford to take on more debt.</p> <p>That, she explains, is why “we really, really need to have some strict regulation” when it comes to the trading of personal data, targeting, advertising and similar practices that flow from social media.</p> <p>Skeggs, who has led the sociology departments at Manchester University and Goldsmiths, University of London, has long looked at less explored vectors of inequality, as demonstrated by her breakthrough 1997 book, <em><a href= ""https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/formations-of-class-gender/book206065""> Formations of Class & Gender: Becoming Respectable</a></em>. She was the joint managing editor of the <em>The Sociological Review</em> for five years starting in 2011, a period that saw the esteemed journal transition into an independent foundation “dedicated to the advancement and study of sociology in everyday life.” (She remains an editor at large for the <em>Review</em>.)</p>",2017-12-01 11:00:00+00,24626b8d3f0a4ee99a498969f674de7b

Kabbalah Media Updates: Audio podcast in Portuguese.

Bnei Baruch is the largest group of Kabbalists in Israel, sharing the wisdom of Kabbalah with the entire world. Study materials in over 32 languages are based on authentic Kabbalah texts that were passed down from generation to generation.

Bnei Baruch Kabbalah Education and Research Institute is an international movement of many thousands of students dedicated to publicly sharing the authentic wisdom of Kabbalah.

Bnei Baruch was established in 1991 by Rav Michael Laitman, PhD (Professor of Ontology and Theory of Knowledge, PhD in Philosophy and Kabbalah, and MSc in Medical Bio-Cybernetics), following the passing of his teacher, Rav Baruch Shalom HaLevi Ashlag (The Rabash).

<h2>Network Marketing Professional Skill &#8211; Starting Them Right</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If you succeed in this business, it’s going to be you who creates that success, not me. And, if you fail in this business, it’s going to be you who creates that failure, not me. You are going to be the difference between success or failure. I’m here to guide you every step of the way, but I can’t do it for you. I’m here to work with you, but not for you.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The importance of making sure your new prospect has reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>Identifying the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to Network Marketing is your job.</p>
<p>Your job is to encourage train and set them on the right path.</p>
<h3>Network Marketing Professional &#8211; Starting Them Right </h3>
<h4>1.   Make Sure Your New Prospect Has The Right Products</h4>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Every company has some sort of product/monthly commitment.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">It&#8217;s imperative that you set them up properly and explain to them the importance of being a product of the product.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">What they do there team will do!</p>
<h4>2.   Make Sure They Have All The Tools They Need</h4>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Introduce them to all of the tools they need to build their business like a professional.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Having the right tools and training to use them is critical.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">This will teach them how to be duplicatable in their business.</p>
<h4>3.   Make Sure They Get Connected To The Team Groups</h4>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Teach you, teammate, how to get connected to all of the Social Media groups that are available.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Getting connected with like-minded people is crucial.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">So, if you have any groups make sure they get added as soon as possible.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Having this support mechanism is key.</p>
<h4>4.    Make Sure The Understand The Basics Of The Comp Plan</h4>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Unfortunately, most people have NO understanding of their comp plan.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Then there are those analytical people that have to know every detail.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">So, you need to have a basic understanding but not necessarily all of the details.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">I give them the basics to get to the building block of the comp plan.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">In our company, it&#8217;s Team Developer.</p>
<h4>5.  Make Sure They Know The Fundamentals of Inviting</h4>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">So, if we step back to one of the first skill sets we see Inviting.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Inviting is one of the first things the new person needs to get good at.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">If you can&#8217;t invite someone to see your presentation you will never have success.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">So, I can&#8217;t stress enough the importance of teaching them to invite properly</p>
<h3>Network Marketing Professional Skill Set #6 &#8211; The Game Plan</h3>
<p>So, here&#8217;s the most important step in getting your new partner started right.</p>

She was a computer science prodigy on the fast path to a career as a leading AI researcher, an entrepreneur, and now the Chief Computing Officer at <a href=""https://www.calicolabs.com/"">Calico</a>, a stealthy, brainy, well-funded startup focused on human longevity.</p>
<p>Along the way, Daphne picked up a MacArthur “Genius” Award and co-founded the online teaching company <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/"">Coursera</a> – two remarkable accomplishments that we don’t have time to discuss on today’s show. Instead, we learn about her fascinating personal journey from Israel to the Bay Area, then spend most of our time getting up to speed on the current state of AI, and learn where, why, and when it’s likely to palpably impact healthcare.</p>
<p>Of particular interest, Daphne discusses the need for folk who are “bilingual” – who deeply understand both AI and healthcare; such domain knowledge, Daphne says, is critically important, and associated with the development of algorithms that perform the best. We discuss the challenge of balancing the benefits of incorporating domain expertise with the concern that in doing so you might introduce your own preconceived biases.</p>

The Christmas Season is upon us and it's time to celebrate Advent. Scripture says, ""The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only son.” John 1:14 (NIV).

Advent is the season during which time Christians of various denominations spiritually prepare to celebrate Christmas, the birth of Christ.  Advent usually takes place yearly from the fourth Sunday before Christmas through December 24.  For years families have made it a household tradition to participate in the Advent calendar used to count down the days before Christmas. Excitement fills the air because each day is celebrated with games, puzzles, activities and treats, in anticipation of the blessed event of Christ's birth.

Advent celebrates these four themes of Christ: HOPE, PEACE, JOY, LOVE

Join us on Tuesday, December 5, 2017, at 3:30 PM,PST, as we talk about celebrating Advent, the concepts, and what the five symbols represent.  Call in to speak with the host (646) 668-2946

Modern science, of course, confirms this ancient wisdom. In fact, the entire field of Positive Psychology was founded on the idea that we need to live in integrity with the core virtues taught by all major wisdom traditions: Courage, Self-Mastery, Integrity, Wisdom, Love, and Transcendence.  Martin Seligman, the “godfather” of the Positive Psychology movement and author of Authentic Happiness and Flourish, created one of my favorite scientific tools to enhance our sense of self-awareness and our ability to live in integrity with our highest ideals.  It’s called the Virtues-in-Action Character Strengths Survey. You can take it in less than fifteen minutes and identify your core virtues so that you can put them into action more consistently in your day-to-day lives—which, science shows, is a really good idea if creating a life of meaning and a sense of flourishing is a priority.  Cruise on over here to take the survey! (http://www.viacharacter.org/www/Character-Strengths-Survey)  For those curious souls, according to the survey, my top signature strengths are:  - Creativity - Hope and Optimism - Energy and Enthusiasm - Purpose - Courage - Kindness and Generosity  I feel best when I’m engaging these core virtues. Therefore, I deliberately find ways to do so.  Today’s +1: What are YOUR signature strengths and how can you put those virtues into action a little more starting today?  Let’s do that.  To your Virtues!  In action. 😃</p>",2017-12-12 20:00:00+00,f40c912aab6b47b5a958015f941c7661

Hosted by Sashka Hanna-Rappl, Founder of BrandSashka, where I Brand Your Soul.
BrandSashka is all about Spiritual Brand Marketing. My gift to see into your Soul and Brand it. I don’t have a heart-breaking life story. I had the BEST upbringing, spoilt with love and attention. Was given freedom to express myself and be me. I drove myself a little crazy always trying to live by the rules when I really wanted to break them. My story is that I’ve gone through life’s “growth” lessons to learn more and more about Consumer Behaviourism – Buyer Behaviour and the Art and Discipline of Spiritual Brand Marketing. And my Ego will confirm – I’m good at this. Which is why I do what I do with an unquenchable passion.

Managing employees and inventory, scheduling appointments and continuing to learn the skills necessary to thrive as a successful cosmetologist.</p> <p>Erica recently made all her efforts official! She’s been a licensed beauty professional for almost 10 years. She writes “I've done freelance hair & makeup for about 5 years. I decided that the only glass ceiling I wanted to hit would be one set by me...not someone else.</p> <p>I am used to working quickly & efficiently with all hair types to achieve results only limited by the imagination. I consistently update my abilities with classes including but not limited to updos and airbrush makeup.

The Muslim Community Radio is a multicultural and multilingual Islamic radio station. It broadcasts to the Sydney community in general while incorporating elements that target the Islamic community of Sydney. It first transmitted twenty-four hours a day during the month of Ramadan of 1995 and has continued to broadcast during every month of Ramadan and Dhul-hijja (Pilgrimage month). In addition, in 1997 Muslim Community Radio was broadcasting on every Friday of that year until the introduction of the temporary broadcast community license (TBCL). Muslim Community Radio currently broadcasts 24 hours 365 days a year covering all Islamic events. Because Arabic/Lebanese is, according to statistics, the major ethnic language communicated among the Muslims in Sydney, understandably the radio programs are primarily transmitted in the Arabic and English languages with spots of other community languages, evolving in pace with demand.

8 Once when Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, 9 he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 10 And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.

11 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 12 When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. 13 But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. 14 He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, 15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. 16 He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. 17 And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”

18 Zechariah asked the angel, “How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.”

19 The angel said to him, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. 20 And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time.”

21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. 22 When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.

23 When his time of service was completed, he returned home. 24 After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. 25 “The Lord has done this for me,” she said. “In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.”",2017-12-04 08:00:00+00,ccbcd6e129404149ba498d72fc3e9d18

<br />
 	* How we LOOK AT what happens<br />
 	* What MEANING we attach to what happens<br />
 	* What we FOCUS on about what happens<br />
 	* What we COMPARE things to<br />
 	* What we EXPECT of ourselves, others and lives<br />
 	* What we REMEMBER about the past<br />
 	* What we IMAGINE will happen next<br />
 	* How much IMPORTANCE we attach to what happens<br />
 	* What we spend our time THINKING about<br />
<br />
So much that goes wrong in the lives of individuals, families, schools and society is caused by people generating more emotion than is necessary or helpful in response to their life events, and what they do because of it, or to deal with it. That is why emotional management is the most important life skill.<br />
<br />
It Simply Means 1) There is always more than one way to look at anything 2) Whatever way we pick will be understandable given our unique life experiences 3) But some will make us feel better, others will make us feel worst 4) Some will make it easier to deal with things, others will make it harder 5) And we always have a choice as to how we want to look at things.<br />
""Life is MIND made""<br />
The way we choose often tends to be automatic. It's often the way we've made that choice many times before. That's why we tend to be relatively unaware that we've made a choice. However, the way we make these choices is not ""cast in stone"". We can learn to make them differently and better. With practice and rehearsal, making them in different ways can become as automatic as the old ways were for how to change what you think, feel, say and do)<br />

Tom Campbell, a nuclear physicist, began researching altered states of consciousness with Bob Monroe Journeys out Of the Body, Far Journeys, and The Ultimate Journey at Monroe Laboratories in the early 1970s where he and a few others were instrumental in getting Monroe's laboratory for the study of consciousness up and running. These early drug-free consciousness pioneers helped design experiments, developed the technology for creating specific altered states, and were the main subjects of study (guinea pigs) all at the same time. Tom is the ""TC (physicist)"" described in Bob Monroe's second book Far Journeys. Campbell has been a serious explorer of the frontiers of reality, mind, consciousness, and psychic phenomena for the last forty years. Using his acquired mastery of the Out Of Body Experience as a research tool, Campbell focused his work toward discovering the outer boundaries, inner workings, and causal dynamics of the larger reality system. The result of this research unites the worlds of objective and subjective experience under one scientific explanation, thus, achieving the goal of generating one unified, comprehensive theory of everything (TOE) that bridges metaphysics and physics with one scientific understanding.",2017-12-14 16:00:04+00,69c8a5e659114076834eb17ef17efbce
