I am a social work believer. And I am very much looking forward to sharing all things social work research with you!\n\nI decided to begin a podcast about Social Work Research, as I was keen to find out more about all the great social work projects out there in our communities, as well as find out how social work research actually works and what makes it social workyâ€¦\n\nEach episode I interview a social work researcher and ask them a few questions about a social work research project theyâ€™ve undertaken. Hopefully over the course of a few episodes we can begin to paint a picture of what social work research is and how it makes a difference!\n\nGo to swdiscoveries.com for more info.",

My gift to see into your Soul and Brand it. I donâ€™t have a heart-breaking life story. I had the BEST upbringing, spoilt with love and attention. Was given freedom to express myself and be me. I drove myself a little crazy always trying to live by the rules when I really wanted to break them. My story is that Iâ€™ve gone through lifeâ€™s â€œgrowthâ€ lessons to learn more and more about Consumer Behaviourism â€“ Buyer Behaviour and the Art and Discipline of Spiritual Brand Marketing. And my Ego will confirm â€“ Iâ€™m good at this. Which is why I do what I do with an unquenchable passion. Join Sashkaâ€™s Facebook community here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/brandsashka/",

    "description_x": "Established in 1995\nThe Muslim Community Radio is a multicultural and multilingual Islamic radio station. It broadcasts to the Sydney community in general while incorporating elements that target the Islamic community of Sydney. It first transmitted twenty-four hours a day during the month of Ramadan of 1995 and has continued to broadcast during every month of Ramadan and Dhul-hijja (Pilgrimage month). In addition, in 1997 Muslim Community Radio was broadcasting on every Friday of that year until the introduction of the temporary broadcast community license (TBCL). Muslim Community Radio currently broadcasts 24 hours 365 days a year covering all Islamic events. Because Arabic/Lebanese is, according to statistics, the major ethnic language communicated among the Muslims in Sydney, understandably the radio programs are primarily transmitted in the Arabic and English languages with spots of other community languages, evolving in pace with demand.",

WAMC's Friday quiz segment, Any Questions? , puts news director Ian Pickus in the hot seat, as he and listeners field questions from resident quizzer Mike Nothnagel. Nothnagel is Associate Professor of mathematics at The Culinary Institute of America, and a crossword constructor for the New York Times and Games Magazine , among other outlets. Often, Mike and Ian switch seats or feature guest answerers, such as Will Shortz, Liane Hansen, John Flansburgh and Mike Doughty. Any Questions? airs Friday during Northeast Report Late Edition on WAMC. Last week's challenge: Start with the word VOLKSWAGEN. Change one letter to a G and you can spell two five-letter words (one singular, one plural) for things you might see in a courtroom. What are they? Answer : If you change the K to a G, you can spell GAVEL and GOWNS. THIS WEEK'S CATEGORY: \"ROCKY\" THINGS On-air questions: On January 26, 1915, President Woodrow Wilson signed an act establishing Rocky Mountain National Park.",
