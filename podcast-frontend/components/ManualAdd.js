    "description_y": "Hayao Miyazaki Films that touched me\n<br />\nHello, I am Randy Andrews and Today is a special show where I will be discussing four, yes count them four Hayao Miyazaki films that have touched me on a personal level. I’ll discuss some of the background, the art the way the film has moved me and a tidbit from the score, all today on Soundtrack Alley!\n<br />\n\n<br />\nHello, Today I’ll be discussing four of my favorite Miyazaki films. These are in the order of which I’ll present them, Nausicaa of The Valley of the Wind; Castle in the Sky; Princess Mononoke; and Porco Rosso. I’ll begin by discussing Nausicaa.\n<br />\nNausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984)\n<br />\n\n<br />\nHayao Miyazaki was still so upset by the truncated 'Warriors of the Wind' version of Nausicaa, that when Harvey Weinstein approached him to discuss the distribution to Princess Mononoke (1997) and insisted on a similar heavily cut version of the film, Miyazaki angrily left the meeting. Several days later, Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzukisent a katana sword to Weinstein's office with 'NO CUTS' embedded into its blade. The film was later released in the USA in its uncut version. During a later interview, Miyazaki commented on the incident by smiling and stating \"I defeated him\".\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe film was initially released in the United States and Europe as \"Warriors of the Wind\" by distribution company New World Pictures. However, the company had substantially modified the film to more closely resemble a traditional action-adventure. Nearly 25 minutes of footage containing vital exposition was cut, and some dialogue was purposely mistranslated to alter or simplify certain story elements. Many of the character names were changed (e.g. Nausicaä became Zandra), and the voice actors were not given the script for context. To make matters even worse, promotional images prominently depicted characters and creatures that weren't even in the film, whereas the female protagonist was placed in the background. Not surprisingly, director Hayao Miyazaki and his Ghibli studio openly despised these changes. When the rights to the picture expired in 1995, they negotiated a new deal with the Walt Disney Company. This led to a re-release in 2005 of the uncut version with a completely new dub that was a more faithful translation of the original script. Miyazaki has since urged viewers to forget the old version, and \"dismiss it from their minds\".\n<br />\n\n<br />\nAfter the heavily re-written and edited 1985 release of this film in the United States and Europe (as \"Warriors of the Wind\"), which substantially changed the movie in addition to cutting nearly 25 minutes of footage, Hayao Miyazaki was hesitant to release any of his film's outside of Japan. Miyazaki demanded that any new licensor for his films be contractually bound to do no edits whatsoever aside from a straight translation and dub. Disney (who bought the rights to all of Miyazaki's films except The Castle of Cagliostro(1979)) has honored this stipulation.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nNausicaä is the name of a character in Homer's Odyssey.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nAdapted from the first two volumes of the original manga which Hayao Miyazaki wrote and drew for Animage from February 1982 through March 1994. He took breaks from working on the manga &amp; worked on the earlier anime films he did. The manga is longer and more complex than the movie, featuring many more characters and places.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe lack of color fidelity used in certain versions give many people the impression that Naussicaä flies around in a miniskirt with a bare butt. This is not the case, she's wearing pants that happen to be roughly the same color as her skin, and the \"skirt\" is actually the lower part of her coat.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nWhile many consider this to be a Studio Ghibli film, it was actually created before the studio was properly founded, and is instead a production of Topcraft. Studio Ghibli was officially founded in 1985, and its first production was Castle in t",

This week we tried to assess whether the 76ers are a viable 50-win team. They had played an interesting schedule and come out largely successful. They are an incredibly productive team but one that still makes a lot of mistakes. What are those mistakes? Are they correctable this season? Might they look to add another veteran player or two to make themselves a more serious playoff team? Whether they do or don’t we think nobody is going to want to encounter them in any round of the playoffs. Why? The Cavaliers are on a double-digit game winning streak. Is everything fine in Cleveland now? The answer is NO, why? The Wizards are trying to maintain contact with the top 4-5 teams in the Eastern Conference while they await the return of John Wall. How are they doing? The criticized roster depth has not been an issue of recent and has actually been award worthy. Is that issue fixed? The answer is NO. Why? And the Celtics are so boringly good now, already? And without Gordon Heyward? They put in the work and get the results. But is this the roster they want to have when April arrives? The answer in NO.

And why do Storm Troopers even bother wearing the plastic guards?  Useless!  They all get one hit and die anyways.\"\nRobert begins reading Artemis by Andy Weir & celebrates Thanksgiving lunch with church after Sunday service with turkey, mashed potatoes, and cranberry pie.\nJermaine reads Oathbringer by Brandon Sanderson & smokes his first turkey.\n\nNerdy News:\nEA Kills Microtransactions for Star Wars: Battlefront 2\nJenny:  \"Sixty bucks to buy Vader?  On top of already buying the game?  And pouring in so many additional hours?  Forget it!  Dead on arrival!\"\nJermaine:  \"Reddit went insane.  EA is totally in the wrong on this one.  EA also took away the 'cancel' button to prevent gamers from canceling their pre-order!  So sleazy!\"\nRobert:  \"What's the big deal?  No one's forcing you to buy and play it.  If you don't like the game then just don't buy it.\"\n\nTrailer Talk - Game Night\nJenny:  \"It seems like a version of murder mystery for nerds.  It has the potential to be pretty okay.  Not worth twenty bucks to see in theater but I'll watch it on Netflix.  Three stars.\"\nJermaine:  \"It's going to be a horrible good movie.  Jason Bateman plays the exact same kinda character in every movie!  I think it'll be fun but I'm not gonna watch it.  Three stars.\"\nRobert:  \"This is a real sign to me nerd and geekdom has truly arrived and gone fully mainstream.  It'll be fine but I won't watch it either.  Two stars.\"\n\nReview - The Punisher\nRobert:  \"This celebration of vigilante justice and gun culture is problematic for me.  I think it's too real and therefore it hits too close to home for me.  Villains are whoever we envision them to be.  Don't recommend.\"\n\"Also, is torture legitimate and justified in times of warfare?\"\nJermaine:  \"Bad guys in The Punisher are cartoonishly evil and over the top-- that's what makes this work.  I like the 'Rambo-comes-home-and-needs-to-fit-back-into-society' story.  Also, I hate Karen.  She's my second most hated character right after Iron Fist!  That said, I recommend the show.  It's phenomenal!\"\n\"It's not what you do in easy times that matters, it's what you do when times are hard.  It's super-simple for me.\"\nJenny:  \"I don't like the realistic fighting gore, like when he's breaking legs.  TV makes it too glorious!  It took me two episodes to get sold on it but I'm in!  I agree that the soldier-coming-home story is good.  Very well done, recommend.\"\n\"You can see from Frank's side who the good and bad guys are but you don't see the other side.  You don't have the whole picture; you're only seeing a piece of the pie.\"\n\nRecommendations:\nJermaine watches Tiger & Bunny on Netflix-- \"The more people you save, the more points you get!  Who'll be the best superhero?\"\nJenny enjoys Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond-- \"A really good watch if you're a Jim Carey fan and if you enjoyed Man on the Moon.\"\nRobert loves rewatching The West Wing-- \"The love of my life!  Especially the first four seasons with Aaron Sorkin as chief writer.\"\n\nCredits:\n\"Those who do evil to others, the killers, the rapists, psychos, sadists, you will come to know me well, Frank Castle had said.  Call me The Punisher.",

EMILY MCCORD/WFDD  </div>\n</figcaption>\n\n  <div class=\"field-body\">\n    <p>On our next Carolina Curious, Greensboro listener Lisa Ross has parking on her mind:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Do people ever get fined for parking in parking spots reserved for the handicapped when they do not have a disability?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As WFDD’s David Ford recently discovered, the question for Ross is deeply personal.</p>\n\n<p>“I’m someone who depends on handicapped parking spots,” says Ross. “I often find there are people parked in there who don’t really need them. Sometimes I’ve approached people to ask them about it and they say, ‘Oh, I’m just going to be in there for a minute,’ but it makes it hard for me to do what I need to do. And I know that there’s a sign posted that says you can be fined for parking in a spot, but there’s no phone number for me to call, and I wonder if people ever do actually get citations for parking there when they shouldn’t.”</p>\n\n<p>For Ross, the biggest challenge involves picking up her children from school. She often finds those parking spots filled by cars without the appropriate placards—sometimes the same car is parked illegally several days in a row.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"right-image\"><img alt=\"Placeholder\" src=\"/sites/default/files/IMG_7825.JPG\" style=\"height:900px; width:1200px\" title=\"Placeholder\" /><figcaption>Accessible parking space in downtown Winston-Salem. EMILY MCCORD/WFDD</figcaption></figure><p>Ross says, “I understand that people think they’re only going to be in there for a minute and they’re just going to quickly run in and out and it won’t cause any problems for anybody. But the reality is that it does cause a problem for me.”    </p>\n\n<p>Ross realizes that phoning the police or a towing company in those situations is impractical. She says it happens everywhere but still, she wishes at least repeat offenders were held accountable, and she wonders if fines are ever levied against them.</p>\n\n<p> According to Winston-Salem Police Sergeant Kyle Krawczyk, the answer is “yes.\"</p>\n\n<p>“Generally, if you don’t have the handicapped sticker or placard displayed in your vehicle, and you’re parked in a handicapped parking spot, you will receive a parking ticket for parking in a handicapped spot.”</p>\n\n<p>Krawczyk says the price of that ticket typically ranges between $100 to $250 dollars, and for state citations, court fees are added. The amount varies depending on the jurisdiction, but it can add up to an additional $180 dollars or more to the total cost.</p>\n\n<p>But even with hundreds of dollars of deterrent in place, the practice remains fairly common according to Krawczyk.</p>\n\n<p>“Parking in a handicapped parking spot is an issue in the city,” says Krawczyk. “And it generally is because of people being in a hurry. They’re in a shopping center, and a lot of times their excuses are, ‘It’s just going to take a minute. I’ll run into the store and run back, and it won’t cause any issues for those that are handicapped, and looking for a handicapped spot to park in.’ So, it is a big concern.”  </p>\n\n<p>Beyond those hurried shoppers impatient to find available parking spaces, Krawczyk adds that offenders are often motorists who have simply forgotten their legally issued placard. He says fake or fraudulent ones are rare.</p>\n\n<p>But High Point Police Lieutenant Jay Yandle says there are many ways in which people abuse their access, as well.</p>\n\n<p>“The placards are actually assigned or registered to people,” says Yandle. “And if that person who is registered to that placard is not in that vehicle, and that person is using the handicapped placard, then that is illegal. You can’t do that.”</p>\n\n<p>Yandle often encounters motorists using the placards of their family members to access those parking spots. And he says he’s even seen abuse by those who have been legally issued temporary placards while immobile and under a doctor’s care due to injury.</p>\n\n<p>“Once that injury heals, sometimes the people will continue to use this placard to park in these spaces. Now, technically it’s not illegal because it is assigned to them. But it’s not exactly right when you might have somebody who is still handicapped that comes up after you and actually needs to use that parking space.\"</p>\n\n<p>People like Carolina Curious questioner, Lisa Ross.</p>\n\n<p>“You know, on a human level I feel really bad,” she says. “Because if I want to take my kids to go to the movies and they’re really excited to see the latest kids movie that’s out, and I can’t get them into the theater? That’s ridiculous.”</p>\n\n<p>So, in the end, the solution to the accessible parking problems in the Triad may be a moment of empathy.</p>\n\n<p>To report illegal parking activity, Lieutenant Yandle recommends contacting your local police department via their non-emergency phone line.</p>\n\n<p>For those in need of available parking placards for their vehicle, there are three different types: a temporary placard that is good for six months, a permanent placard good for five years, and a license plate placard that displays a wheelchair on the North Carolina registered plate that is good for one year.  </p>\n\n<div data-pym-src=\"//modules.wearehearken.com/wfdd/curiosity_modules/274\" id=\"hef80\"> </div>\n<script src=\"//assets.wearehearken.com/production/thirdparty/p.m.js\"></script>  </div>\n\n  Story does not include AP content<div class=\"field-tags tags\">\n      <a href=\"/tags/accessible-parking\">#accessible parking</a>      <a href=\"/tags/mobility-challenged\">#mobility challenged</a>      <a href=\"/tags/wheelchair-user\">#wheelchair user</a>      <a href=\"/tags/carolina-curious\">#carolina curious</a>      <a href=\"/tags/lieutenant-jay-yandle\">#lieutenant jay yandle</a>      <a href=\"/tags/sergeant-kyle-krawczyk\">#sergeant kyle krawczyk</a>      <a href=\"/tags/handicapped-placards\">#handicapped placards</a>  </div>\n\n  <a href=\"/crime\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Crime</a>\n  Normal<div class=\"easy_social_box clearfix horizontal easy_social_lang_und\">\n            <div class=\"easy_social-widget easy_social-widget-twitter first\"><a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\"\ndata-url=\"https://www.wfdd.org/story/carolina-curious-real-cost-parking-illegally\"\ndata-count=\"horizontal\"\ndata-lang = \"en\"\ndata-via=\"\"\ndata-related=\":Check it out!\"\ndata-text=\"Carolina Curious: The Real Cost Of Parking Illegally  \">Tweet</a></div>\n          <div class=\"easy_social-widget easy_social-widget-facebook\"><div data-href=\"https://www.wfdd.org/story/carolina-curious-real-cost-parking-illegally\" class=\"fb-share-button\" data-layout=\"button_count\"></div></div>\n          <div class=\"easy_social-widget easy_social-widget-googleplus\"><div class=\"g-plusone\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"bubble\" data-href=\"https://www.wfdd.org/story/carolina-curious-real-cost-parking-illegally\"></div></div>\n          <div class=\"easy_social-widget easy_social-widget-linkedin last\"><script type=\"in/share\" data-url=\"https://www.wfdd.org/story/carolina-curious-real-cost-parking-illegally\" data-counter=\"right\"></script></div>\n  </div> <!-- /.easy_social_box -->",

You know--it's 9:00 AM, the phones are ringing and the customers are complaining.\n   How do you make that transition as a follower of Christ?\n\nInterested in applying the Bible to your everyday life?

Forth District is an online collective of artists, makers, creatives, writers, thinkers, and activists calling Christians to think, make, and live more engaged with culture for the sake of the mission.<br />\nBIOGRAPHY (Taken from <a href=\"https://humblebeast.com/artists/sho-baraka/\">Humble Beast website</a>)<br />\nEducated at Tuskegee University and the University of North Texas, Sho studied Television/Film, Anthropology, and Public Administration. He has become an artist, philosopher, and social-thought leader in contemporary culture. He has spent nine years traveling the world as a recording artist and public speaker. He has done numerous overseas activist work, ranging from race relations in South Africa to establishing musical cohorts in Indonesia. He is a founding member of nationally known Christian hip-hop group 116 Clique. Sho Baraka is also the founder of <a href=\"http://forthdistrict.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forth District</a>.<br />\nHe now desires to blend his artistic platform with his academic leanings to contribute a unique perspective in both arenas in hopes of raising the standard, thereby raising the culture. Sho currently lives in Atlanta, GA and co-leads a consulting network that is active in cultural renewal.<br />\nSUMMARY<br />\nIn this chat, we tackle questions and thoughts like&#8230;<br />\n&#8220;What is the story behind Forth District? Why does it exist?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;How is your vision for Forth District unique from other work you&#8217;re involved in (like Humble Beast, Rebuild Network, Legacy Conference, I got Something to Say podcast show, etc.)?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;How do you create a common space or vision for different people to express their unique stories together?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Is Forth District a proprietary ATL thing or can it be duplicated/modeled for other contexts?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;What one thing would you want men to take away from the story of Forth District?&#8221;<br />\n<br />\nConnect&#8230;<br />\n<a href=\"https://humblebeast.com/artists/sho-baraka/\">Sho Baraka on HUMBLE BEAST</a><br />\n<a title=\"Rob on Facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/shobaraka/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sho Baraka on Facebook</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmIshoBaraka\">Sho Baraka on Twitter</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://forthdistrict.com/\">Forth District &#8211; Conscious Culture</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://theandcampaign.com/\">AND Campaign (&amp; Campaign)</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://terminuscollective.org/leadership/\">Terminus Collective</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http://missionalman.com/33shobaraka/\">&nbsp;</a>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');lang: en_US",

The case is Masterpiece Cake Shop vs. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The case is about cake artist Jack Phillips, who refused to make a special wedding cake for a gay couple because of his belief about traditional marriage. The gay couple complained to the state’s civil rights commission, which ruled that Phillips violated the state’s non-discrimination laws, and that his religious beliefs did not matter. The case wound its way through the courts, until the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. On Tuesday, both sides presented their arguments. Today’s WLN Digest is an overview of this case as it stands. Find more details at Alliance Defending Freedom’s website adflegal.org/detailspages/case-details/masterpiece-cakeshop-v.-craig.",

Lowe</a> examines eighth-century Japanese practices that ritualized writing, or, in other words, conceptually and practically set sutra-transcription apart from other forms of writing. Drawing on a rich trove of eighth-century documents that describe everything from donation sums and sources, to the types of paper used, to the purification rites practiced prior to transcription, to records of which scribes had borrowed or returned their brushes, Lowe provides us not only with an expert analysis of the religious meaning of various aspects of sutra-copying, but also with a detailed description of the fascinating ritual and material culture of public and private scriptoria and intimate glimpses into the lives of the patrons and laborers of these institutions. More broadly, Lowe&#8217;s book asks us to rethink our assumptions about ritual, for in the case studies found within we see ritual used not simply symbolically&#8211;as a representation of a pre-extant cultural or political system&#8211;but rather as a social and ethical practice that generates new communal identities and offers opportunities for individual cultivation. Ritual, Lowe shows, is not just a result, but also a cause.<br />\nIn the first part of the book Lowe looks at the ritualization of writing. Here we learn of the way in which sutra-copying and purification rites executed prior to copying are simultaneously ethical, soteriological, and ritually efficacious. That is, copying a sutra in the ritually correct and pure way was conceived as morally upright, but also as an act that would bring about the rituals intended results and by which one would make soteriological progress. In this part of the book Lowe also introduces a type of prayer text called a ganmon, and shows how these texts drew on Buddhist and non-Buddhist language to create a uniquely East Asian genre that was unquestionably Buddhist even as it incorporated norms and imagery from non-Buddhist sources.<br />\nIn the second part of the book we learn about the ways in which ritualized writing was produced by certain forms of social and institutional organization, but also about the ways in which this practice in turn affected those forms of organization. Lowe discusses grassroots fellowships of pious friends that were formed for the purpose of commissioning sutra-transcriptions, and also examines private and public scriptoria, which were highly bureaucratic. A key theme in this part of the book, and indeed throughout this work, is that taking a closer look at the networks of people and institutions involved in the production of ritualized writing calls into question the stark divisions between state, aristocratic, clan, and popular Buddhism, divisions that are often assumed in research on this period. Many of the fellowships that Lowe examines, for instance, were created by individuals who had strong ties to the state and to certain clans, but whose intentions, while in part political and aimed at forming new social ties between groups, were also deeply personal, pious, and religious.<br />\nIn the third part of the book Lowe provides us with two carefully crafted microhistories. First, we read about the career of a scriptorium worker who served as a scribe, proofreader, and administrator, and find that rather than simply being a cog in a sutra-copying bureaucracy, through his work this individual developed his own religious, literary,",

Many times, people aren’t even aware of the nicknames that others have given them behind their back. Well, Jesus had someone in his family tree who had a notorious nickname. And her nickname was not a term of endearment. She was known as “Rahab the prostitute.” Yet, Matthew doesn’t rush right past that fact. Rather he makes sure that we know that there was an infamous prostitute in the Jesus’ family tree. Matthew had his own nickname. And, again, it was any but a term of endearment. He was called “Matthew the tax collector.” In this message, we’ll discover that no matter what nickname you might have earned, Jesus calls people to follow him, even while they are still wearing their labels.",

Shouldn&#8217;t you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this? <sup id=\"en-NIV-28442\">3</sup>Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present. <sup id=\"en-NIV-28443\">4</sup>When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present, <sup id=\"en-NIV-28444\">5</sup>hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"#fen-NIV-28444a\">a</a>]</sup>may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"en-NIV-28445\">6</sup>Your boasting is not good. Don&#8217;t you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough? <sup id=\"en-NIV-28446\">7</sup>Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. <sup id=\"en-NIV-28447\">8</sup>Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"en-NIV-28448\">9</sup>I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— <sup id=\"en-NIV-28449\">10</sup>not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. <sup id=\"en-NIV-28450\">11</sup>But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"en-NIV-28451\">12</sup>What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? <sup id=\"en-NIV-28452\">13</sup>God will judge those outside. &#8220;Expel the wicked man from among you.&#8221;<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote b\" href=\"#fen-NIV-28452b\">b</a>]</sup></p>\n<h4>1 Corinthians 6</h4>\n<h5>Lawsuits Among Believers</h5>\n<p><sup id=\"en-NIV-28453\">1</sup>If any of you has a dispute with another, dare he take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints? <sup id=\"en-NIV-28454\">2</sup>Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases? <sup id=\"en-NIV-28455\">3</sup>Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life! <sup id=\"en-NIV-28456\">4</sup>Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men of little account in the church!<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote c\" href=\"#fen-NIV-28456c\">c</a>]</sup> <sup id=\"en-NIV-28457\">5</sup>I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers? <sup id=\"en-NIV-28458\">6</sup>But instead, one brother goes to law against another—and this in front of unbelievers!</p>\n<p><sup id=\"en-NIV-28459\">7</sup>The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated? <sup id=\"en-NIV-28460\">8</sup>Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"en-NIV-28461\">9</sup>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders <sup id=\"en-NIV-28462\">10</sup>nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. <sup id=\"en-NIV-28463\">11</sup>And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</p>\n<h5>Sexual Immorality</h5>\n<p><sup id=\"en-NIV-28464\">12</sup>&#8220;Everything is permissible for me&#8221;—but not everything is beneficial. &#8220;Everything is permissible for me&#8221;—but I will not be mastered by anything. <sup id=\"en-NIV-28465\">13</sup>&#8220;Food for the stomach and the stomach for food&#8221;—but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. <sup id=\"en-NIV-28466\">14</sup>By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also. <sup id=\"en-NIV-28467\">15</sup>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! <sup id=\"en-NIV-28468\">16</sup>Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, &#8220;The two will become one flesh.&#8221;<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote d\" href=\"#fen-NIV-28468d\">d</a>]</sup> <sup id=\"en-NIV-28469\">17</sup>But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"en-NIV-28470\">18</sup>Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. <sup id=\"en-NIV-28471\">19</sup>Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; <sup id=\"en-NIV-28472\">20</sup>you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.</p>\n</div></section>\n<div style='height:50px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n<section class=\"av_textblock_section \"  itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/CreativeWork\" ><div class='avia_textblock  '   itemprop=\"text\" ><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li id=\"fen-NIV-28444a\"><a title=\"Go to 1 Corinthians 5:5\" href=\"#en-NIV-28444\">1 Corinthians 5:5</a> Or that his body; or that the flesh</li>\n<li id=\"fen-NIV-28452b\"><a title=\"Go to 1 Corinthians 5:13\" href=\"#en-NIV-28452\">1 Corinthians 5:13</a> Deut. 17:7; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21,24; 24:7</li>\n<li id=\"fen-NIV-28456c\"><a title=\"Go to 1 Corinthians 6:4\" href=\"#en-NIV-28456\">1 Corinthians 6:4</a> Or matters, do you appoint as judges men of little account in the church?</li>\n<li id=\"fen-NIV-28468d\"><a title=\"Go to 1 Corinthians 6:16\" href=\"#en-NIV-28468\">1 Corinthians 6:16</a> Gen. 2:24</li>\n</ol>\n</div></section>\n<div style='height:50px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n<section class=\"av_textblock_section \"  itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/CreativeWork\" ><div class='avia_textblock  '   itemprop=\"text\" ><p><em>Scripture taken from the HOLY BIBLE, NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION®.

And that certainly includes your physical health. From time to time, I like to talk about taking care of our bodies, because if we’re tired, sick, worn-out, and depressed, there isn’t much left in order to be successful in other areas of life. So today, New York Times Bestselling author of the brand-new book, <em>The Keto Zone Diet</em>, Dr. Don Colbert, joins me again to teach us that inflammatory diseases exacerbated by chronic stress and anxiety can be mitigated and even eliminated by eating the right foods for our bodies. Then right after my conversation with Dr. Colbert, Britnie Turner joins is here to give us a few quick, actionable steps to help us develop better time management strategies for everyday life.</p>\n<h4><strong><em>Buy the Book</em></strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1683970241/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1683970241&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wintoday02-20&amp;linkId=8c31d46aa0dfef565de51d442881107e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=1683970241&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;tag=wintoday02-20\" border=\"0\" /></a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wintoday02-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1683970241\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1683970241/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1683970241&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wintoday02-20&amp;linkId=c2c0d1d99ac3f40701a62a73a8d99c3a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Colbert&#8217;s Keto Zone Diet: Burn Fat, Balance Appetite Hormones, and Lose Weight</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wintoday02-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1683970241\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Achieve optimal healthy living through <em>Dr. Colbert&#8217;s Keto Zone Diet</em> &#8212; burn fat, balance hormones, and lose weight. </strong>Wanting or needing to lose weight?

Connecting with Jesus Christ is the most important thing in life. Why the name Shores of Truth? The ocean is large and deep touching every continent on the earth. Each land mass is different and each shore, where the ocean meets the land, is different and yet the same ocean touches them all. Some shores have sand and different colors of sand, while others are only rocks or cliffs. The ocean waves approach and move differently at each shore as well. God is deep and there is a lot of truth revealed about Him in the Bible. Each item posted may provide a different view point, but points to the same large body of truth found in the depths of God.",

It is even more difficult to find a modern mystic. In Swami Tripurari we have both: a traditional mystic who can articulate the teachings of an ancient spiritual tradition. A compelling speaker, to hear him and be in his presence is itself a spiritual experience.\nSwami Tripurari met his initiating guru, Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in the spring of 1972. He relates that he felt as though he had met a long-lost friend, as Srila Prabhupada blessed him with his all-knowing glance. Over the years of service that followed, Srila Prabhupada showered him with affection and repeatedly expressed his appreciation for his selfless service and ability to inspire others. In 1974 Srila Prabhupada instructed him in a widely circulated letter, “So you organize freely. You are the incarnation of book distribution. Take the leadership and do the needful.” Accordingly, Swami Tripurari has set an example of one who is independently thoughtful and capable of making an insightful literary contribution to the world. In 1975 Swami Tripurari was initiated by Srila Prabhupada into the renounced order of sannyasa.",

Throughout the story of Israel, it seems as \nif God continues to miss his opportunity, but when we get to the Christmas \nstory, we see his timing was perfect and gracious all along. Christmas \ntells us that no matter how bad things get, God is present and he is \nworking for the good of his cherished creation.",

And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.\nAnd the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.\nAnd he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God. - 1 KIngs 19:1-8</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>1.  Worry takes over</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come - Proverbs 26:2</span></pre>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? - Romans 8:31</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Don&#8217;t give in to worry.  We spend most of our time sitting around and worrying about things that we can not change or fix.  Philippians 4:6-7 tells us to stop being so full of care and to stop worrying about things.  Instead just turn them over to the Lord.  He is the only one who can fix them:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"> I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.\nThe LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?\nThe LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.\nIt is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.\nIt is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes. - Psalms 118:5-9</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>2.  Leave the place of blessing</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there. - 1 Kings 19:3</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don&#8217;t leave the place that the Lord is using to give you a blessing.  For the Christian, that place is the Local Bible Believing  Church!  When looking for a blessing, go where the blessings are;  If you need some gas for your vehicle you wouldn&#8217;t go to the hospital and if you needed stitches, you wouldn&#8217;t go to the gas station, you go to the place that is best equipped to solve the issue that you need to be resolved.  For the Christian that place is the Local church that the Lord has placed you into.  Don&#8217;t leave the place that the Lord has placed you.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t leave the Bible either.  The word of God will bring you a blessing if you will spend time in it.  Leaving the Bible when you are in need of a blessing is similar to skipping a meal when you are hungry.  I realize that the last sentence does not make any sense, but neither does avoiding Gods word when you need a blessing.</p>\n<h2>3.  Abandonment of friends</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">...and left his servant there. - 1 Kings 19:3b</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don&#8217;t leave your friends behind.  God brings people into your life for a reason:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. - Proverbs 27:17</span></pre>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.\nFor if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.\nAgain, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?\nAnd if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.-Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Elijah abandoned his servant, Don&#8217;t abandon your fellow servants.  As a Christian, you are now a servant of the Lord:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.\nI speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.\nFor when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.\nWhat fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.\nBut now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.\nFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. - Romans 6:18-23</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He left his servant so that he could do what he wanted to do without any interference.  That is what people do, they leave the people behind that God has placed into their lives to keep them from doing the very thing that they are now doing.  That is what it means by iron sharpening iron in Proverbs 27:17 (above).  By staying and serving together, we will make each other better.  Life is not easier without eh people that God has placed in yo9u path.</p>\n<h2>4.  Self pity</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers. - 1 Kings 19:4</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Juniper Tree&#8217;s have low spreading long branches that are covered with needle-like leaves.  This would have been extremely uncomfortable.  Miserable people do things to stay miserable.  Some people just are not happy unless they are unhappy.  Don&#8217;t place yourself in a situation that is going to prolong your misery.  Sitting around and thinking about yourself and how awful your circumstances are, will not ever help you to feel better or to better those circumstances.</p>\n<h2>5.  Stop trying</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers. - 1 Kings 19:4</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Elijah put himself in a place of feeling like there was no use in trying anymore.  He said it is enough, that is translated as &#8220;I Quit!&#8221;  He actually asks the Lord to take his life.  He had convinced himself that his thoughts were reasonable thoughts.  If he wanted to die, he should have just stayed where he was in the beginning and let Jezebel kill him as she promised to do.  He didn&#8217;t really want to die, he just wanted some sympathy, otherwise, his next action would not have been to take a nap!</p>\n<h2>6.  Overlooking all past blessings</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.\nAnd he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.\nAnd the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.\nAnd he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.\nAnd he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? - 1 Kings 19:5-9</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is easy, while going through a trial to forget about everything that the Lord has already brought you through.  This is exactly what has happened to Elijah at this point.  He forgot that the Lord had been blessing him all through his ministry:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Declared a drought (1 Kings 17:1)</li>\n<li>Multiplies the widow&#8217;s flour and oil (1 Kings 17:7-16)</li>\n<li>Resurrects the widow&#8217;s son (1 Kings 17:17-24)</li>\n<li>Calls fire from Heaven (1 Kings 18:1-40)</li>\n<li>Sends rain (1 Kings 18:41-45)</li>\n<li>Out runs a  chariot (1 Kings 18:46)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How quickly we forget about all of his blessings in our lives.  We get tunnel vision and can only see the trial that we are currently experiencing, and forget about all of the times that the Lord has delivered us before.  Elijah had just been making fun of the prophets of Baal for not receiving an answer to their prayers (1 Kings 18:21-29), does he now think that his God is asleep?  Do we?  Of course not, but that is how we act when we forget about all of the past blessings that we have received.</p>\n<h2>Even if you have quit before, it is not too late</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"> And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?\nAnd he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.\nAnd he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:\nAnd after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.\nAnd it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?\nAnd he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. - 1 Kings 19:9-14</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Elijah was given a chance to repent.  God asked him, Why are you here all alone?  Elijah had his justifications as to why he was all alone and had given up on the ministry.  He was the only one that was doing right, he was the only one left, and they just wanted to kill him, so he didn&#8217;t have a choice but to quit.</p>\n<p>The Lord demonstrated his power to Elijah; to remind him of who it was that he served.  The Lord is all powerful and if he is for you, who can be against you?  After the Lord reminded Elijah of who he was and who he was serving, he asked him again.  Why are you here?  Elijah does not change his answer.  He missed the entire point or what the Lord was demonstrating to him.  Notice that the answer that Elijah gives the second time in verse 14 is identical to the answer that he gave in verse 10.  He didn&#8217;t change.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t follow Elijah in this error.  The Lord wants to give you a chance to repent and to finish what he has started in you.  He wants you to fulfil the ministry that he has given you to fulfil:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">..Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. - Colossians 4:17</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fulfil your ministry, if you have gotten off track, you can get it fixed today!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> Our hope at Irvington Bible Baptist Church is that this podcast provided some encouragement and has helped you to develop a closer relationship with the LORD Jesus Christ. </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IrvingtonBibleBaptistChurchPodcast/~4/3-0SHnDXRn8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

(NKJV)</p>\n\n<p>Until our souls are healthy and prospering, nothing else will prosper</p>\n\n<p>Hebrews 11:1-3 1 Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. 2 This is what the ancients were commended for. 3 By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.</p>\n\n<p>The redemption of your story begins with a healthy soul!!!</p>\n\n<p>Hebrews 12:1-3 1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, 2 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.3 Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.</p>\n\n<p>Weight and Sin will lead to WEARINESS</p>\n\n<p>WEARINESS leads to DISCOUARAGEMENT</p>\n\n<p>Exodus 6: 9 Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor.</p>\n\n<p>DISCOURAGEMENT Leads to</p>\n\n<p>BITTERNESS Hebrews 12: 14 Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord. 15 See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many. BITTERNESS Poisons the Soul</p>\n\n<p>QUESTIONS:</p>\n\n<p>What are you carrying that you shouldn’t be carrying?</p>\n\n<p>What are you NOT doing that you should be doing?</p>",

Had a DStory Time with Uncle JimmyD where I read the entirety of the work so you can respond to co-workers or others who raise the topic.  Then we discussed Bill MounceDs comments on DwhoeverD at John 3-16. Followed that with a quick discussion of Francois Veron and the use of skepticism by Rome in the Counter-Reformation. Then I read a Muslim article about todayDs Supreme Court case about religious freedom and what the QurDan honestly teaches about homosexuality -and the foolishness of liberal Muslim groups who have opposed religious liberty-.  Finally we spent some time reading and responding to Dr. Sonny HernandezDs response to me on Arminianism and the Gospel, and frankly, I still havenDt a clue exactly where he is coming from.  But, we gave it the old college try-  Nearly 110 minutes for the program today.",

    "description_y": "Big Idea: Walk in the middle of difficulty in light of the hope that we have in the rule and reign of Jesus.\n\nI have a question for you this afternoon: What is your hope?\nNo matter how good your life is right now, you’re living off the hope that things will get better. We all are. Nobody wants just more of today. We can’t survive without hope. In a recent article, psychiatrist Aaron Kheriaty observes the startling rise in deaths from suicide and drug overdoses. He points to a number of long-term studies that have analyzed the difference between high-risk patients who survive and those who die by suicide. Here&#8217;s his conclusion of this research:\nOver a ten-year span, it turns out that the one factor most strongly predictive of suicide is not how sick the person is, nor how many symptoms he exhibits, nor how much physical pain he is suffering, nor whether he is rich or poor. The most dangerous factor is a person&#8217;s sense of hopelessness. The man without hope is the likeliest candidate for suicide. … We cannot live without hope.\nThat’s pretty amazing. Nobody wants to suffer, but you can suffer if you have hope. Nobody wants to be poor, but you can survive being poor if you have hope. “The most dangerous factor is a person&#8217;s sense of hopelessness. The man without hope is the likeliest candidate for suicide. … We cannot live without hope.”\nSo let me ask you again: What is your hope? Is it a certain level of income? The perfect romantic partner? A certain level of career success? Children? We’re all hoping for something. To be human is to hope.\nThe problem, even if we have hope, is twofold: life is hard, and our hopes don’t deliver as much as we desired. Usually the thing that we hoped for doesn’t turn out to be as good as we’d hoped. But even if it does, it doesn’t last that long. Or even if it does, it still doesn’t satisfy us as we’d hoped. Historian Daniel Boorstin suggests that we suffer from all-too-extravagant expectations. In his much-quoted book, The Image, Boorstin makes this observation:\nWe expect anything and everything. We expect the contradictory and the impossible. We expect compact cars which are spacious; luxurious cars which are economical. We expect to be rich and charitable, powerful and merciful, active and reflective, kind and competitive …. We expect to eat and stay thin, to be constantly on the move and ever more neighborly, to go to a &#8220;church of our choice&#8221; and yet feel its guiding power over us, to revere God and to be God. Never have people been more the masters of their environment. Yet never has a people felt more deceived and disappointed. For never has a people expected so much more than the world could offer.\nRead that last part again: “Yet never has a people felt more deceived and disappointed. For never has a people expected so much more than the world could offer.”\n\nLost Hope\nWe’re not the first to experience disappointment, of course. This morning we’re looking at a passage from the book of Isaiah. Isaiah was a prophet in Israel who lived 2700 years ago during a time when things weren’t very good. Israel was controlled by Assyria, a major world power. Moses had said that God had promised to “set you in praise and in fame and in honor high above all nations that he has made, and that you shall be a people holy to the LORD your God, as he promised” (Deuteronomy 26:19). But Israel felt like a two-bit backroads state with not much going for it. Israel knew war and destruction. When Isaiah wrote, Assyria was expanding its power while Israel went through a succession of kings. Israel lived under the shadow of a great empire that threatened to swallow it up at any moment. Talk about disappointment! God’s promises didn’t seem to be coming true.\nOn top of that, Isaiah hardly seemed to be helping things. Isaiah …",

Because of her own experiences of being a Christian in the marketplace, Mary Whelchel had a burden to encourage women and to teach them sound biblical principles in order to equip them to live godly lives in their workplaces. Little did she know that the radio program which had its humble beginnings on one station in Chicago would now be heard on over 500 stations and crossing international boundaries! Since its beginning The Christian Working Woman has become a non-profit organization currently producing two radio program formats, distributing books and materials, providing web resources, and organizing retreats and conferences in the United States and abroad.",

    "description_y": "<p><strong>PROGRAM D-7980</strong></p>\n<p>Does it seem to you that God is silent in your life right now? There is a story in the Bible that will encourage you. The Gospel of John tells about Jesus&#8217; friends Lazarus, Mary, and Martha. When Jesus found out that Lazarus was ill, he didn&#8217;t rush to heal him. Instead, Jesus stayed where he was for two more days (John 11:6). Before Jesus arrived in Bethany, Lazarus died.</p>\n<p>To Mary and Martha, Jesus&#8217; silence was a great puzzle. They both said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, our brother would not have died.” You can hear the questions in their words—why, why, why? They knew Jesus could have gotten there in time if he had wanted to, and they knew he could have healed Lazarus. They could not understand. Certainly, they could have interpreted Jesus’ actions as neglect—that Jesus didn&#8217;t care or didn&#8217;t want to help them.</p>\n<p>But there <em>was</em> a purpose for Jesus&#8217; silence; Mary and Martha just couldn’t see it at that time. They couldn’t see his footprints because these were unseen footprints. Jesus used his silence to do something greater. Four days after he died, Lazarus was raised from the dead by Jesus, showing his power! As a result, many came to saving faith.</p>\n<p>You may never be able to decipher exactly how all of life’s pieces fit and what they all mean, but that’s when you need to exercise the even-if-he-doesn’t faith. You must remain faithful and obedient to the God who is still in control, still sovereign, and still holding you in his hand—even though you don’t see or feel it. This is the kind of faith that’s pleasing to God—a faith that’s determined to trust him when he hasn’t answered all the questions, and when you haven’t heard any voice from heaven.</p>\n<p>God will speak to you through his Word, perhaps not answering the question “Why?” but revealing the all-important “Who.” You can rest in the knowledge that you and I will never, in this life, understand completely all of God’s ways—they are and always will be above our ways. We have to resist trying to explain an unexplainable God.</p>\n<p>Instead, would you <em>choose</em> to trust God and continue believing he has a plan and a purpose, even though the future looks dark? Will you <em>choose</em> to believe that his footprints are there in your life, even though you may not see them right now? Will you <em>choose</em> to trust that he is working for your good?</p>",

The culture, the faith and the language are interwoven in a way that defines Irish identity. With this cultural fusion the Irish evangelised the world. There are probably more missionaries per capita from Ireland than from any other nation in human history. In ‘modern’ Ireland today, some would tend to almost exorcize the faith from Irish identity, to create a kind of secularised Ireland. According to today’s guest, this ’New Ireland’ has little or nothing to do with what it means to be truly Irish. Writer and commentator Eugene Dunphy has examined the bond between the Irish language, the culture and the faith. In a fascinating journey through Irish history, Dunphy talks to Kevin Turley about faith and Irish culture through the ages.",

Whose side would Saint Nick take in the war on Christmas?</em></p>\n<p>This is an all Saint Nick barrel-aged episode with Adam English. Learn about the historical St. Nick, the person behind the myths and legends and the confusion surrounding him, how he challenged systems of oppression, a brief history of Catholic social teachings, and how St. Nick provides the best model for the Christmas season.</p>\n<p>Adam talks about the types of practical questions the christological heart of St. Nick poses to the church in the Christmas season, the ways we edit not just the historical person of St. Nick, but also the incarnation and birth narratives of Jesus to make them more palatable for our contemporary society, and he asks: do we need to get rid of Christmas to save it? or do we just give in and remove any vestige of Christ from Christmas? Plus, Tripp and Adam talk about how to negotiate (especially for parents) the history and myth of St. Nick while also preserving the mystery.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in reading more (and some excellent stocking stuffers) check out these books by Adam:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Saint-Who-Would-Santa-Claus/dp/1602586349/ref=la_B001JSFACU_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513301342&amp;sr=1-1\"><em>The Saint Who Would Be Santa Claus</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Theological-Anticipations-Adam-English/dp/1498239323/ref=la_B001JSFACU_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513301342&amp;sr=1-2\"><em>Christmas: Theological Anticipations</em></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not too late to get your tickets for the LIVE podcast in DC with <span>Diana Butler Bass and the folks from Crackers and Grape Juice in on December 16th.</span><span> </span><a href=\"https://homebrewedchristianity.lpages.co/upending-the-war-on-advent-live/\">You can get tickets and learn more here</a><span>.</span></p>",

See the 3 steps below to re-activate your energy.\n\nYou see that they are simply manifestations of your super powerful energy. [And, of course there are no mistakes, only manifestations of our energy output – which makes it super easy to see what we might not have seen otherwise! For it is a law of the universe, and like attracts like. So, if you are attracting situations/people, etc., that you don’t wish to, then these “mistakes” are giving you the necessary information to look within; to see what is hidden that needs to change.]\n\nAnd when you see it this way, you can easily take responsibility for creating your “mistakes”. You can look at them as tools for your growth; showing you what your energy output is aligning with.\n\nStep #1, get clear on what you are vibing on the inside; what do you believe about any situation, person, place or thing.\n\nStep #2, get clear on what you want to attract, and then choose some thoughts that are positive that would align you with a more positive aspect of a person, place or thing.\n\nStep #3, find your motivation. For those that think these first 2 steps are a dirge, and take energy, you will create it that way. Shift your thinking\n\n~Vicki Murphy",

We have a textual problem in that the words were received as three different blocks of teachings which were somehow woven together. Firstly, He comes to Jerusalem to warn the nation. Secondly, is the teaching of the coming of the Son of Man Thirdly, there is a teaching that concerns itself with persecution. We are to interpret scripture correctly so that we can correctly apply it to our lives. These words of Jesus will never pass away. Our ability to live out these words will determine our intimacy with the Father. We need to apply these words to the life we are living today. Jesus tells us to watch out, stay alert, don’t be deceived. These words are good, no matter when we live, for the end of life and for the second coming. In pointing out the stones of the temple, Jesus in effect replies, don’t rely on the things that will fail. Testing is to reveal what is in our hearts. Jesus is telling us we will go through suffering but says, “I will be with you. The gospel is opposed at every turn, and Jesus is handed over, and so will we … but, \"I will be with you.”  We need to prepare ourselves.\nReadings: Isaiah 64:1-9, Mark 13: 1-37<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChristChurchJerusalemPodcast?a=tNCFgW0Mcok:u9tF_078Fwo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChristChurchJerusalemPodcast?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChristChurchJerusalemPodcast?a=tNCFgW0Mcok:u9tF_078Fwo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChristChurchJerusalemPodcast?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ChristChurchJerusalemPodcast/~4/tNCFgW0Mcok\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

There is nothing light hearted about it.   I’m not going to make it sound light hearted, that wouldn’t do justice to its context.  But having said that, we can find some hope here and some encouragement for our own hearts and minds. </p>\n<p>Over the last several weeks we have learned some of the aspects of the birth of Jesus Christ, and of some events that immediately followed His birth into this world.  It&#39;s good stuff! The Christ has come. But His coming would not happen without controversy.  His coming from the beginning caused a stir among the people in His region.  We have seen some of that stir.  The wise men came from the east, following a star, bringing gifts and worshiping King Jesus.</p>\n<p>The wise men coming alerted Herod, the known king of the land, that Jesus had been born and that He was thought by some to be the new King of the Jews. As we have seen, this got Herod’s attention.  Herod met with religious leaders to see what this was all about, he talked with the wise men and tried to convince them that he was like they were, a man who wanted to worship the Messiah. God intervened and told the wise men to leave another way, avoiding Herod.  Our account starts at this point.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Matthew 2:16 Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wow! The lengths that people will go to in order to protect and preserve what they value is incredible. Herod valued, highly valued his kingdom and all that his kingdom provided for him.  We are going to try and get inside Herod’s mind here, but in doing so let’s not fail to consider what we value and the lengths we may go to to protect what we love most.  Herod is an extreme, I know, but we can be as well. Look at Herod with me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Matthew 2:16 Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He believed that the wise men tricked him, tricked the king.  Herod was not a man that others were allowed to trick.  To trick King Herod could be a deadly decision.  He was proud, arrogant, powerful.  Herod ruled with an iron fist.  He had killed before and would not hesitate to kill again to preserve his kingdom and his power. Men who have much, have much to lose, and Herod was not going to lose.  How does a man get to this point?</p>\n<p>Believing he had been tricked, he became furious. To be furious is to be “extremely angry so as to not be able to think.”  This is pure emotion which rules a person in an extreme case, red hot anger.  This is an anger that communicates, ”How dare you cross me. You will feel my wrath!” It is uncontrolled anger that most often seeks revenge.  This is where Herod was.  And why?  Because what he loved most was being threatened.</p>\n<p>Look, we are not immune from such awful sinful behavior.  I don’t mean that any one of us would commit the heinous act that we are about to read about, but we are not above sinning in order to protect an idol in our lives.  We are not above loving something so much that we are willing to sin in order to preserve it – willing to lie in order to maintain some false good reputation, willing to cheat in order to gain financially, willing to dress provocatively to gain attention, willing to lash out at people in order to keep them under our control. Think about it: what do you love most and how do you preserve it?</p>\n<p>Here is what Herod was willing to do in order to preserve his kingdom: &quot;he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.&quot;</p>\n<p>Murder. Murder of children.  Murder of all male children two years old and under.  How far will people go?  Herod, in his fury, had children killed.</p>\n<p>I cannot even begin to imagine what that night would have been like for families in that region.  Herod made a quick decision that those lives were of little value compared to his personal desires, and so he could justify his action, his command. This should send a chill down our spines.  It should because it is an illustration of how far sinners can go, sinners who love themselves first and foremost.</p>\n<p>Have you even been entangled in some sin and just contemplated where it could lead?  Or have you ever observed someones else’s habitual sin and thought of where it might lead?  Sin, unrestrained sin apart from repentance, is a path of progression. James 4 shows a progression of sin.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>James 4:1 What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? 2 You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see this idea, this truth that passions are at war within us. Strong desires for things that God prohibits for our good.  There is a war.  And if this continues, and if we desire, strongly desire something that we do not have, it leads to sin, &quot;murder&quot; James says.  &quot;You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel.&quot;</p>\n<p>When our passions rule us, then our passions will lead us to sin.  We are not to be ruled by our passions, but we are to have self-control.  </p>\n<p>This terrible thing that Herod did was talked about in Jeremiah.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Matthew 2:17 Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: \n18 “A voice was heard in Ramah, \nweeping and loud lamentation, \nRachel weeping for her children; \nshe refused to be comforted, because they are no more.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The quote in 2:18 is from Jeremiah 31:15. Jeremiah prophesied during the decades leading up to and immediately following Judah’s fall to Babylon. His ministry was one of proclaiming doom and judgment – if you&#39;ve read Jeremiah lately, you&#39;ll see that. However, he, like most Old Testament prophets, included a message of hope, of forgiveness, and restoration. Jeremiah 30–31 gives us a lengthy discussion focused on the future restoration of Judah. They were being taken captive, but they were going to be restored. Jeremiah, in his declarations here, mentions the sorrow and devastation of Judah, by way of contrast with the joy that would follow. Jeremiah’s specific prophecy relates to the captivity in Babylon and the killing of children during Babylon’s conquest of Judea. Children were killed. So this parallel is interesting with what we see in Matthew 2.</p>\n<p>The verse in Matthew regarding the children being slaughtered by Herod is one of these sorrowful, terrible notes common in Jeremiah’s ministry. But in its context it is immediately followed by this: “This is what the Lord says: ‘Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for your work will be rewarded,’ declares the Lord. ‘They will return from the land of the enemy. So there is hope for your future,’ declares the Lord” (Jer. 31:16–17). In the middle of some terrible things that were happening, God instructs Jeremiah to declare, &quot;Your hope is still in the Lord.&quot; Perhaps the parents who were suffering in Bethlehem with the loss of a child, perhaps they found comfort in the Lord’s promise, trusting Him, even without understanding what had just happened. Believing that there was some kind of purpose behind the tragedy. Matthew probably intended that his readers here, being familiar with the Old Testament passage, would understand that God has purpose in what He does, and even that the Messiah was coming to the region.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned a few minutes ago, this is a difficult passage for us to think on.  And yet, we can find great hope in the gospel as we consider it.  Our own hearts and minds can be encouraged. This is what I mean: when we are confronted with terrible sin, whether ours, sin that we commit, or terrible sin against us, we can go to Christ, the gospel of Christ and find hope.</p>\n<p>Apart from Christ, we have no hope. We would be devastated by sin in this world, we would be left in despair and we would suffer not just now but for all eternity.  But the truth is Jesus came to give life and to give it abundantly.  Jesus came to give comfort to the hurting and strength to the weak.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Psalm 34:17 When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears \nand delivers them out of all their troubles. \n18 The Lord is near to the brokenhearted \nand saves the crushed in spirit. \n19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous, \nbut the Lord delivers him out of them all. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because Jesus came and because of His love for us, we are not slaves to the effects of sin that is all around us and even in us.  We have been called to live new lives in Christ.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2 Corinthians 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is this new that has come? It is peace.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>John 14:27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is the new that has come? Joy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Romans 15:13 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is anticipation of life with Christ in heaven.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>John 14:3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Security in Christ Jesus.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ephesians 1:13 In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Christians we are not slaves to sin, nor are we slaves to its effects on us.  We are new creatures with peace, joy, hope of eternal life, and security in Christ. This is the new life we have been given. Apart from Christ we are Herod, but with Christ we are transformed, God’s children, secure in His arms. Our hope is not in this world, nor in the events that we see around us; our hope is in Christ alone, and the promises He has given to us.</p>\n<p>We have a choice as to whether we will focus our lives on the here and now, and the terrible effects of sin around us, or whether we will focus on Christ and His work in and around us and in this world.</p>",

Phyllis Hall) - Gwen Ingram and Bobby White Prepare the Way (Harlan) - CHOIR Come, Thou Long-Expected Jesus (STUTTGART) :: Sermon Manuscript (pdf) :: This \"manuscript\" represents an early draft of the sermon. Some weeks the spoken version varies more than others from the early manuscript. Nevertheless, if you'd prefer to read than to listen, this is provided&nbsp; for that purpose. Today is the first Sunday in Advent and the first sermon in a series called “Advent with Jesus’ Relatives.” Advent is meant to be a time in which we prepare both for Christmas and for Jesus’ return. Today I’d like to start on a very practical note and talk about the importance of silence and solitude to having a meaningful Christmas. I think for many or most of us, this can be one of the most hectic times of the year. Kids are in special programs at school and at church. There are Christmas parties of all kinds – with the office, neighbors, friends and family. There is shopping to be done and many folks travel. Even here at church we have some of our biggest services, programs, and missions of the year. We are trying to focus on the birth of Christ and on helping those in need, but it’s also more to do, go to, and be a part of. All of that has its place and certainly focusing on Jesus’ birth and the real meaning of Christmas is a vital part of a meaningful Christmas. But today, I want to look at a very special biblical text that may challenge us to try something a little different this year. Today’s text is the story of a miracle pregnancy – not Mary’s, but that of her cousin, Elizabeth. There are several points we could focus on, but I’m going to focus on just two that are kind of tucked away in the details. Miraculous News (vv.5-17) Zacharias and Elizabeth were in a busy time of year. Zacharias was a priest and, as was the custom, rotated through various duties at the Temple. At this particular time, he was schedule to offer the incense offering inside the Temple. This high honor typically only happened to a particular priest once or twice in a lifetime. It was the closest an ordinary priest (i.e., not High Priest) would come to the presence of the Lord in the Holy of Holies. The people would have been at worship in the Temple courtyards while this offering was going on. It was there that Zacharias had a vision of an angel, who came with news from the Lord. This wasn’t the first time such a thing had happened, but I guess you never think God’s going to send you a hotline. Zacharias and his wife, Elizabeth, were going to have a baby. Like Sarah and Abraham before them, Zacharias and Elizabeth were past child-bearing age and Elizabeth had been unable to conceive when they were younger. She was barren, an emotional and challenging thing in any place and time, but particularly so in a culture where children and family were so very important. In fact, having many children was part of the covenant with Abraham and his descendants and to be barren was especially difficult for a couple who were heirs of that promise. And like Abraham and Sarah before him, Zacharias fearfully recognized the angel for who he was, but found the message laughable. And this was no hazy promise of one day having a child. This was a full-on vision and promise, with details including the baby’s name, calling, and future. He was to be called John, be raised under strict guidelines, and promised to be a prophet like Elijah. And Zacharias asked the question any of us probably would have asked, “How can this be?” (Or, we might add, “Are you sure you’ve got the right guy?”) Now here’s where a mirac",

This has always been and will always be the hope and eager expectation of Advent -- a time in which we take a close look at the coming of Christ in humility as a baby and anticipate His future coming at the Second Advent. This is a time for watching, waiting, remembering, and rejoicing in God's fulfilled promise of the Savior. This is the Season of Promise!\n==========\n\nAdvent: The Promise of Hope\n\nIf everything leaks hope, then what or who can hold my hope?\n\nHope means a confident expectation of the future.\n\nRomans 15:13\nMay the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.\n\n1. May the God of hope.\n\n2. May the God of hope fill you.\n\nMay the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace.\n\n“Peace is resting in joy – joy is dancing peace! Joy cries hosanna before the Well-Beloved, but peace leans her head on His bosom. We work with joy, and we rest with peace.” \nCharles Spurgeon\n\nMay the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing.\n\n3. So that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.\n\nThe God of hope is longing for us to abound in hope.\n\nHope for the believer in Christ.\n\nIncrease the regularity that you are in the Scriptures.\n\nIdentify some of the misplaced hopes you have in your life.\n\nHope for the non-believer in Christ.\n\nReceive the gift God is offering you.\n\nRomans 5:1-5\nTherefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.\n\nGenerosity\nYou can give online by clicking the link below. We thank you so much for all of your generosity.\nhttp://www.hopeinanderson.com/generosity\n\nHope News This Week!\nFind out what's happening at Hope!\nhttp://mailchi.mp/4002d9accb37/hope-news?e=b7ab6304a6\n\nThanks for Joining Us!\nThanks for being with us this week.

We are all grateful for the path that brought us here and we remain excited about what God will do through us as a family, church and community. What I am so thankful for is that God has granted me the unquenchable desire to help people grow into mature Christians. When considering the cost that Christ paid on my behalf I have been left with the reality that I exist to glorify God in all I do and to lead others into an intimate relationship with Him.",

The Bible uses both ideas to describe our condition. “HOPELESS” describes the terminal condition of the sinners. If a person persists in rejecting Christ as his Savior, then they are left to experience this hopelessness throughout all eternity. “HOPEFUL,” on the other hand, depicts the repentant sinner who experiences the reality of “Christ in you, the hope of glory”. The HOPE we have in Christ is a confidence concerning God’s presence in our lives today and the comfort we have in being in God’s presence throughout eternity. Are you HOPELESS or are you HOPEFUL? Your condition is determined by your response to the greatest gift ever given to man!",

    "description_y": "睚鲁的圣经世界-速读利未记12-27\n\n我们继续来速读追求利未记12-27章，在这次的读经里，我们讨论了这些章节里讨论的妇人生产的不洁等其他情形，利未记的这下半部分花了很多的细节来讨论此类的不洁，包括前面说到的妇人生产的不洁、男人遗精造成的不洁、麻风病人带来的不洁等，当然也说到如何通过献祭或者洗涤等仪式来消除这些不洁。\n\n这里就涉及到一些神学上有争论的问题，特别是对于我来说，我基督徒的背景是比较注重这些东西的属灵意义和蕴含的，并不太注重这些事物所处的历史背景等研究，但是因为我现在在就读美国联合神学院的博士预科课程，该学校的创办人是发明飞机的莱特兄弟的父亲、也是一个牧师创办的，位于俄亥俄州，他们的学校的传统是植根于约翰卫斯理。我上旧约课程的教授在教导旧约的时候，就非常强调学习和研究旧约那个时候以色列人的历史背景以及沿革。\n\n这两种解释圣经的方法之间，常有争论，我从自己的亲身经历中特别有体会。对于凡事都是用属灵意义来解释的方法，当然我们的解释说，这是圣灵的启示来的，或者我们是以经解经。但这些注重历史研究的教授就会说，你这是凭空而来，没有什么依据。而对于注重属灵解释的圣经教师来说，过分注重历史的背景以及沿革，则会陷入人的天然里面去。因为你无论如何努力去了解和研究这些历史，但是实际上的情形是，我们对于这些历史背景知之甚少，很多借着研究和考古得来的资料，不见得是准确的。\n\n比如说，这一段经文提到的麻风病人的详细条例（13-15章），到底是为着属灵的意义，来说明我们今天要如何避免属灵的麻风病呢，还是说这是神给当时的人设立的卫生条例，让以色列人能够避免大规模地发生麻风病的流行情形，从而保证以色列人的健康福祉，让他们能够健康繁衍下去，给他们留存种子，然后基督能够借着他们诞生呢？\n\n圣经明确说到，神规定以色列人不可以做很多事情，因为这些是当地迦南人的风俗，包括把孩子献给偶像或者经过火祭等等，连出埃及的的灾害，也有说法是说这些都是针对埃及的各种偶像来实施的灾害。\n\n我个人觉得，这些属灵的解释和历史背景的研考，需要平衡地结合起来，两者都不可偏废，详情请收听我们的讨论。",

Singlehood is inextricably linked to a post-structural analysis of time: not only are single women judged on their single status based on how old they are, but Lahad argues that being single often ages women at a faster rate in the eyes of others. This book offers a brilliant analysis of singlehood and how different aspects of popular culture depicts this intersection of identity. From movies and television shows, popular stories, and online commentary, the ways that these aspects of our culture shapes the identity of a single woman is far-reaching and pervasive. This book is a great read for anyone interested in yet-to-be-fully-explored aspects of gender studies or anyone that has been bothered by the question &#8220;why are you still single?&#8221;<br />",

    "description_x": "The modern technologies in medicinal and agricultural biotechnology are powerful tools that can address a wide range of problems.  From improved plants, animals and microbes, the technologies known as genetic engineering (familiarly \"GMOs\") are mostly misunderstood and oftentimes maligned.  These technologies are well regarded by scientists, yet approached skeptically by a concerned public.  The disparity has been conjured by prevalent misinformation on the internet and in activist literature and documentaries. At the same time farmers and scientists have not been good communicators about what the technology is, and isn't. <br />\n<br />\nThe Talking Biotech Podcast is a weekly podcast that provides science-based discussion on current topics.  The discussion is led by Dr. Kevin Folta, a professor with training in these areas and familiarity with the scholarly literature.  Guest will describe current issues in biotechnology, twitter-based questions are answered, and there is a segment dedicated to plant genetic improvement from domestication through today's breeding efforts. <br />\n<br />\nThe podcast is geared to anyone wishing to know more about biotechnology, its risks and benefits, and how it can be used to help farmers, the needy, consumers and the environment.",

The consolidation continues, as large companies are buying each other, concentrating technology and resources in a few corporate hands.  Prof. Sylvie Bonny from INRA discusses the concerns and impacts of consolidation, as presented in her recent review in Sustainability.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/9/1632/htm\">Download the paper discussed here.</a><br />\nFollow Dr. Vincelli:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pvincell\">@pvincell</a><br />\nHis blog: <a href=\"https://vincelliblog.wordpress.com/author/pvincell/\">Out-of-the-box</a><br />\nLike the podcast?  Please subscribe and write a review!<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=68340&amp;refid=stpr\"> Stitche</a>r    <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/talking-biotech-podcast/id1006329802\">iTunes</a>   <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/talking-biotech-podcast\">Player FM</a>  <a href=\"https://poddirectory.com/talkingbiotech\">Pod Directory</a>  <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/Talking-Biotech-Podcast-p794716/\">TuneIn</a><br />",

    "description_y": "<p>Good morning, RVA! It's 48 °F, and things have cooled off the tiniest bit. Today, expect highs right around 60 °F and continued sunshine.</p><h2>Water cooler</h2><p>OK my dudes, hold on to your butts, because the first weekend in December is a major holiday weekend in Richmond. Here's what's on the boughs-of-holly-covered deck:</p><p>We've got warmish weather for tonight's <a href=\"http://thejamescenter.com/grand-illumination/\">Grand Illumination</a>. The lights kick on around 5:50 PM.</p><p>Down the street at Main Street Train Station at 6:15 PM, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/155796911685510/\">100 tubas will play Christmas music</a>? This kicks off \"Shop the Shed,\" a new winter market in the Train Shed that'll run through the entire weekend.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.richmondparade.org/\">Christmas Parade</a> begins at 10:15 AM on Saturday and stretches down Broad Street from the Science Museum to 7th Street.</p><p>And then there's <a href=\"http://www.rvakrampus.com/p/events.html\">RVA Krampusnacht</a>—you know, when folks dress up as <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/gammaman/11244852815\">terrifying Christmas monsters</a> and walk around Carytown. That's on Saturday at 6:00 PM.</p><p>Dangit, this is not the lede I wanted to read in the recap of last night's School Board meeting: \"The Richmond School Board on Thursday delayed a vote on a facilities plan originally scheduled for next Monday.\" You can and should read <a href=\"http://www.richmond.com/news/local/education/city-of-richmond/richmond-school-board-postpones-vote-on-a-facilities-plan/article_0b48c9ae-843c-5f63-8c9f-de085b728a52.html\">Justin Mattingly's full recap over on the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>. A positive takeaway: Interim Superintendent Kranz did present Board Members <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmattingly306/status/936382272256823296\">with detailed information on the two school facilities plans</a> (PDF presumably pending)—a definite improvement over his previous Presentation Lite. I definitely wasn't in the room last night and admittedly have a really hard time tracking with finance-related stuff, but I'm confused by the impassioned pleas from School Board that \"education must become a priority in this city.\" Like, who are those pleas directed toward? The Mayor, through the vehicle of the Education Compact (which, remember, includes both City Council and School Board), has committed to figuring out how to fund the first five years of a facilities plan. As far as I know, we're waiting on the School Board to appoint its members to the Compact. We're waiting on the School Board to pick a path forward on a facilities plan. From the outside, it seems like everyone's stoked on making education a priority, we're just waiting on the School Board to start making moves. Eduheads, is this way off base?</p><p>Graham Moomaw and Andrew Cain report that <a href=\"http://www.richmond.com/news/local/loupassi-who-previously-conceded-to-adams-files-for-recount-in/article_1f4606fa-fb25-5e6e-b37a-e88e238f3043.html\">Manoli Loupassi has requested a recount in the 68th House of Delegates election</a>, an election he conceded when he lost to Dawn Adams by 336 votes back in November. With a handful of other district races still in limbo (the 28th, 40th, and 94th), it sounds like we still won't know who controls the House until maybe next year. <a href=\"https://rvamag.com/politics/virginia-politics/a-house-contested-the-virginia-house-of-delegates-explainer.html\">Rich Meagher explains the whole situation in more detail over at RVA MAG</a>.</p><p>The struggle is real for people with December birthdays! Here's <a href=\"http://richmondmagazine.com/life-style/an-overabundance-of-celebrations/\">a whole article about it by James Warren in Richmond Magazine</a>.</p><p>Last night <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2017/11/30/c2118302-d5e7-11e7-a986-d0a9770d9a3e_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_taxreform-1142am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.11503a612f49\">Senate Republicans failed to find the votes to pass their tax plan</a> that would raise the deficit by a trillion bucks. It'd also probably wreck Obamacare, but that's true of seemingly every action taken by Senate Republicans.</p><p>Another administrative note! Ross's Tour of America continues, and, on Monday, I'll be headed back from Milwaukee. We will speak again on Tuesday (My birthday! See above). Have an excellent first weekend of December here in Richmond without me!</p><p><em>Sports!</em></p><p><strong>Rams</strong> host Old Dominion on Saturday at 7:00 PM.</p><p><strong>Spiders</strong> head to Winston-Salem on Saturday at 4:00 PM to take on Wake Forest.</p><p><strong>Hokies</strong> and Ole Miss tip off at 2:00 PM on Saturday.</p><p><strong>Wahoos</strong> welcome Lehigh to Charlottesville at 12:00 PM on Saturday.</p><p><strong>Dukes</strong> face Stony Brook on Saturday at 2:00 PM in the second round of the Football Championship playoffs.</p><p><strong>Washington</strong> fell to the Cowboys, 14-38.</p><h2>This morning's longread</h2><h3><a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/54/the-unspoken/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-english-sentence\">The Rise and Fall of the English Sentence</a></h3><p>Why is our written language so different than our spoken language? How come no one writes like Henry James anymore? Language is so interesting!</p><blockquote><p>Modern languages with a long literary tradition show a stark split between their written and spoken styles across many contexts. In current English, writing uses more varied vocabulary than conversational speech, and it uses rarer and longer words much more often. Certain structures (such as passive sentences, prepositional phrases, and relative clauses) appear more often in written than spoken language. Writers generally elaborate their ideas more explicitly through syntax whereas speakers leave more material implicit. And written language stacks clauses inside each other to a greater depth than spoken language. This is one of the most striking differences between speech and text; sentences like the opening line of the Declaration of Independence simply do not occur in conversation.</p></blockquote><p><em>If you’d like to suggest a longread, go chip in a couple bucks on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gmrva\">the ol’ Patreon</a>.</em></p>",

Today we talk about social networks, the morally ambiguous things they do, how it served as a manipulation tool during elections, how the economic model of the Internet (advertising) incentivises companies to put up with bad actors, abusive users, and sometimes even lead them to act immorally by themselves. We also touch on the horrific situation on Manus Island, and the #MeToo movement of women coming out against their sexual harrassers and abusers. And of course, how post-capitalism continues to be a nightmare. It's a fun episode!",

    "description_y": "Episode 41 of #TwoWiseJawns is available for your listening pleasure on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, Google Play, and SoundCloud.\n\n\"She's Gotta Have It\" was Spike Lee's insightful 1986 film about a liberated woman extolling her self-expression and reclaiming her time! \n..by wasting other people's tehe. \n\nWhy must dating always be so zero-sum!\n\nThis episode we discuss the 2017 take on \"She's Gotta Have It\" which premiered on Netflix Thanksgiving Day as a series. \n\nThanks to Nola Darling, we deep dive into the themes of sexuality, relationships, compromise, feminist mystique, millennial angst, gentrification, and more. \nAnd of course we rank our favorite suitors of hers -- Opal, Mars, Jamie, Greer. \n\nFinally, we apologize for excluding Lady Raqueletta Moss from the narrative. She was in the notes! We got carried away Iyanla'ing Nola and blocked our blessings. \n\nHOT TOPICS:\n- Migrant crisis and stability vacuum facilitate slavery in Libya and the region.\n- Morgan's prediction that Rihanna would marry Prince Harry is false (for now). He's decided on another sis of the diaspora, Miss Meghan Markle. \n- Naya Rivera is a domestic abuser -- Santana Lopez would not go out like this... okay she would, but still. \n- David Ortunga is waving his Men's Rights flag -- wins primary custody of his and Jennifer Hudson's child. \n- Joyner Lucas may not be racist but he ain't it either. \n- Ann Curry sipped champagne and the finest Beluga caviar upon the news of Matt Lauer's termination from The Today Show. \n- Kim Kardashian is the Social Justice Warrior we need -- hired a top lawyer for Cyntoia Brown. \n- Lt. General Michael Flynn dropped names! Means nothing. Trump is the Teflon Don apparently. \n- The House and Senate passed the GOP Tax Plan and it's peak Republican. \n\n\nRecorded Sunday, December 3, 2017.",

Whether you are a patient seeking relief, or on your way to a party or the beach, knowing what effect taking cannabis will have on your human is exceptionally helpful. Potency testing and manufacturing standards have not been part of the prohibition-era cannabis market. As normalization widens and international cannabis trade begins, manufacturing standards are being developed that will impact the entire world. On this week’s episode of Shaping Fire, podcast host Shango Los speaks with Jahan Marcu about how these standards are coming together and why they matter.</p>",

And while scholars have studied religious diversity in the context of modern nation-states, such as India, Pakistan, Tibet, or Nepal, seldom has the Himalaya been the focus of examination in and of itself. <a href=\"https://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/religion/faculty/employee_detail.dot?empId=04054809320013399&amp;pageTitle=Megan+Adamson+Sijapati\">Megan Adamson Sijapati</a>, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Gettysburg College, and <a href=\"https://religion.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jvanbirk\">Jessica Vantine Birkenholtz</a>, Assistant Professor of Religion at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, remedy this scholarly void in their new collection of essays, <a href=\"http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QjTtSMFSJhhwNR5CSYSejksAAAFgafF19wEAAAFKARAaL5c/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0415723396/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0415723396&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=StC98S.SOSJRWJSmTaCSZw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Religion and Modernity in the Himalaya</a> (<a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Religion-and-Modernity-in-the-Himalaya/Sijapati-Birkenholtz/p/book/9780415723398\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Routledge</a>, 2016). the volume explores religious responses to Himalayan modernity as witnessed in the cultural encounter with new social realities, expectations, and limits. The characteristics of the Himalayan region are fluid, moving beyond geographical boundaries, or mountain and valley zones, as are the contemporary human processes of meaning-making in the face of globalization and modernization. In our conversation we discuss how modernity operates, the social and political factors shaping the Himalayan religious environment, processes of emplacement, Tibetan Buddhist media, environmentalism and development, changing pilgrimage practices, the Nepali Goddess tradition, political limits to religious education, and the dynamics of perceived margins and discourses of peripherality.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://drkristianpetersen.com\">Kristian Petersen</a> is an Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Nebraska Omaha.

The DCEU is playing catch-up with the MCU... but probably won't catch them. Marvel had more time to develop the individual backstories before the Avengers was released, where DC had to rush to get the Justice League out. </p>",

This is the journey and vision of Alf Herigstad, founder and host of Being A Better Man.  It is a journey he hopes to inspire other men to join him on.  The regular episode will be released every Monday.  It will be a mix of solo episodes and interviews with relevant guests.  On Wednesdays Alf will share a true story from his strange and interesting life, and then discuss the moral of the story, or lesson learned.  Fridays are Free For All Fridays, a short episode where Alf will discuss things that are time sensitive, answer listener questions, share new idea\\\\\\'s and revelations.  Every episode produced here at Being A Better man will be aligned and relevant to the mission of the show, so now prepare to have your thoughts provoked...your ego challenged...and your character tested.",

</span>I plan to share these insights with you in upcoming episodes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Today however, for my first episode back in a while we have a special guest who is going to share his personal story with us. </span></h3>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This interview has been scheduled for about three months as well.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>In fact we sat down and recorded it one day several weeks ago and that was when I realized that my technology was not working…it didn’t record.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Now thankfully, that issue is resolved and<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>and I am finally able to share this inspiring interview with you.</span></h4>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This guest started out as a listener of of this show and I noticed him pretty early on for two reasons.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>One, because he was always liking things and leaving some comments and two, because he had kind of an unusual name that I really liked. </span></h4>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Being named Alf all my life, I kind of have a thing for unusual, clever names, I appreciate them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This persons name was Les Moore.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Get it?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Less…more?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Anyway, He and I had a few interactions over the course of time and one day he sent me a letter really explaining what he has been up to.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>When I heard his story I knew immediately that he should be a guest on the show because he epitomizes what we are trying to do here at Being A Better Man.</span></h4>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Les Moore hails from Pennsylvania.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He is a 47 year old married father of two daughters.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>In January of 2014 Les decided that he wasn’t totally happy with himself for reasons I’ll let him explain.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He made a decision that would alter the course of not only his own life, but also the lives of his wife and daughters and probably everyone else that knew him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Les Moore decided to become a healthy, vital, man. </span></h4>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When he made this decision he weighed 234 pounds.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He was on prescriptions for high blood pressure and high cholesterol.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Today he weighs 185 pounds, that means he lost 62 pounds of fat, and he is totally off all prescriptions.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>His blood pressure and cholesterol are normal.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Not only that, Les decided to go the extra mile and do the work it took to become an International Sports Sciences Association certified fitness professional.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>That’s right, Les became a personal trainer and he is training people in his home studio.</span></h4>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of my favorite parts of Les’ story is that he did something I always talk about here;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>he became an <strong>example</strong> for his entire family.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>He became such an example that he inspired his wife Lori to get into the gym and she has lost a staggering 130 pounds as well.</span></h4>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">There are some things I want you to pay special attention to in this interview:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"p1\">\n<h4> Les&#8217; motivation, the reason he made this decision to become healthy.</h4>\n</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">\n<h4>  What is the biggest payoff Les has noticed.</h4>\n</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">\n<h4>  Process goals vs. Outcome goals.</h4>\n</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">\n<h4>  Advice for the holiday&#8217;s</h4>\n</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">\n<h4>  Les&#8217; personal message to all of you out there who may want to make a change.</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>Here is a picture of Les, before and after his transformation.  From 234 pounds to 185 pounds.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a

From 'Door Slammer' to 'Spoon Licker', 'Sausage Swiper' to 'Meat Hook', the Yule Lads - part of Icelandic folklore stretching back centuries - can be mischievous and menacing, stealing from pantries, playing pranks and scaring children.\n\nThese days they are known to leave gifts in children's shoes (or a potato in the case of the badly-behaved) but their parents - evil ogress Grýla and her lazy husband Leppalúði - are still the subject of frightening tales, known to eat naughty children. Even their pet Yule Cat prowls the country's towns and villages looking for lazy people to eat.\n\nWith music, sound, poetry and accounts from Icelanders bringing the tales to life, Gerður Kristný guides an atmospheric exploration of Iceland's festive stories, providing insight into unique Icelandic cultural traditions and revealing larger, universal, questions about folklore and why we tell scary stories. \n\nAward-winning poet and author Gerður Kristný won the 2010 Icelandic Literature Prize for her poetry book Blóðhófnir, which is based on an ancient Nordic myth. She has also written award-winning novels and short stories for both children and adults.",

There are many battles taking place in the field of astrology and beyond right now.  So what do we do?  Perhaps staying in the heart while looking above and staying grounded below is advisable?

    "description_y": "<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe infamous PILOT bill is finally being challenged. Liberty &amp; Prosperity, a constitutional advocacy group lead by Seth Grossman, has teamed up with Atlantic County Exec Denny Levinson. Both sides presented arguments in front of Superior Court Judge Mendez on Nov 30. Both are convinced that the PILOT is un-constitutional.<br />\n<br />\nGrossman, a Somers Point attorney and former Atlantic City councilman, refers to the PILOT as 'Payment in Lieu of Peanuts Taxes.' <br />\nThe goal of the Casino PILOT was to stabilize Atlantic City’s tax-collection base. Wildly inaccurate assessments contributed to Atlantic City's near bankruptcy and eventual state take-over. The PILOT bill allows casinos to collectively pay $120 million per year instead of actual property taxes and allows them to upgrade their properties without tax implications.<br />\nCounty Exec Denny Levinson said Seth Grossman was outstanding in front of Judge Mendez. 'He was terrific.' <br />\nThe current PILOT allows a private entity to gaining at the expense of the average taxpayer. Not review-able for 8 years. Every non-casino property will see tax hikes, says Levinson.<br />\n<br />\nListen to Levinson on WOND Radio, Dec. 1, 2017<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nOther notes: The Chiesa firm representing the STATE is out, effective Jan. 2018. Til then, it's another payday for that law firm, says Denny. Most recently, the Levinson family took a personal hit by standing up against Gov. Christie. With the County fighting the PILOT in court, the outgoing and very unpopular Governor pinked slipped the very capable Matt Levinson, son of the County Exec. Matt was not re-appointed to his position on the Casino Control Commission. That’s how Christie rolls.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition, Atlantic County believes it should receive at least 13.5% of PILOT revenues, based on agreements with both AC Mayor Don Guardian, and Gov. Christie. (WATCH VIDEO)<br />\n<br />\nhttps://youtu.be/QBxXpvT1bek<br />\nEverybody in legislature agrees. 13.5% should be given to taxpayers. Something that was verbally guaranteed by the outgoing Governor Christie.<br />\nPress of Atlantic City thinks 10% is fine? Levinson pointed out that the Press of Atlantic City printed inaccurate data on the morning of Dec. 1, 2017. Was this just an error on the editor's part?<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;",

Not only did he make his receivers and the offense better, but the defense was on the field for far fewer plays, making that unit stronger and more efficient as well. Garoppolo is a legit QB, and the San Francisco 49ers have found their piece to that puzzle.\n\nDavid Lombardi (http://www.twitter.com/LombardiHimself) from The Athletic joins Steph (http://www.twitter.com/SoCaliSteph) and me (http://www.twitter.com/49ersfangirl) to talk about all things 49ers, including:\n\nThe new QB of course\n- The feeling in the 49ers’ locker room and throughout Levi’s Stadium\n- The upcoming game against Houston\n- The benefits of winning, no matter what that does to the Draft\n- And the top needs the Niners have going into the offseason.\n\nThanks for listening!

Robert Mugabe is not longer the President of Zimbabwe after being forced out by the Military.

(And, did I mention? she's a friend).</p>\n<p>We will talk about the recent verdict in the Kate Steinle case and about illegal immigration in general. Could we shut down sanctuary city policies by systematically raiding restaurants, hotels, landscaping companies etc. in those cities and putting the owners of said companies in jail? Do that for four weeks in San Francisco and how long before the business owners in the city go over to E-Verify and a repeal of sanctuary status?</p>\n<p>Our second topic is the recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to let the Trump travel ban go fully into effect. This is temporary, but suggests that the Supremes are leaning in a Trumpian way on this issue.</p>\n<p>We will have our shower thoughts (actually, only mine. Todd begs off). and our hidden gem is from rising folk star John Craigie, <em>I am California</em>. (you'll love it Dick from Brooklyn!).</p>\n<p>This week also begins Mike's blog over at Newsmax.

For those who don’t know, Harrison was inaugurated in March 4th, 1841 and died on April 4th, 1841. It was a time positioned between the Revolution and the Civil War filled with characters who played a pivotal role in American history. Harrison rode into office with a decisive majority in 1840, beating incumbent president Martin Van Buren but was just in the midst of getting his administration going when his life was cut short. The podcast series will examine the America of 1841, some of the major figures of the time, the issues that were being faced, and attempt to answer the question of why the one month president is more important than he’s been portrayed to date in histories of the time.",

The historic site provides great insight into Calhoun&#8217;s domestic situation and about the enslaved people whose lives Calhoun held in his hands, both as a slave owner and as a national leader.<br />\nPictures from the trip can be located at <a href=\"/2017/12/03/046-pictures\">http://whhpodcast.blubrry.com</a><br />\nThe campus map can be located at the following link: <a href=\"http://www.clemson.edu/campus-map/\">http://www.clemson.edu/campus-map/</a><br />\nSources:<br />\n<br />\n* “Fort Hill Home of John C.

Dale invites Julia to talk about her new book, Tenements, Towers, and Trash: An Unconventional Illustrated History of New York City, which is an extraordinary, eclectic, ambitious work full of beautiful drawings of New York as it once was and as it appears in the present day. Like Dale, Julia enjoys a good historical tangent, and the book contains numerous insightful digressions into the personalities and peculiarities that continue to shape modern city life. Having a touch of seasonal sadness this time of year, Dale maybe picks up on maybe too much emptiness in some of Julia&#8217;s work, but the two have a fine conversation about spending time alone and growing up among the strange architecture in old buildings. Plus a deep dive into the ancient messages of hot springs, an update on the wildfires, and Dale recounts his first visit to Manhattan. </p>\n<p>To purchase Julia&#8217;s latest book, <em>Tenements, Towers, and Trash</em> &#8211; visit a fine bookstore in your neighborhood before it becomes a New York Sports Club, or order <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tenements-Towers-Trash-Unconventional-Illustrated/dp/0316501212/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1513188062&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=tenements+towers+and+trash\">online</a> and watch your mailperson wince as they carry it up the steps. Julia is also selling original pages from the book and they are amazing and beautiful and you should get one. Lots of great gift ideas here in the Deep Night Holiday nook!

Sex might be a part of your D/s relationship, but that&#8217;s not actually what it&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s about an exchange of power. Sex is just one of the many potential details you negotiate with a consenting partner.<br /> In this episode:<br /> <br /> * D/s does not equal sex.<br /> * D/s doesn’t have to involve sex or it can.<br /> * If all you want is rough, kinky sex, that’s cool.

In fact, the episode seemed to focus on nothing, instead showing us almost everyone we care about. It could have been called Don't Stick to the Plan or Questionable Decisions!

    "audio": "http://traffic.megaphone.fm/ADL2092946446.mp3",
    "audio_length": 2896,
    "description_y": "The Detroit Pistons have bounced back from an incredibly disappointing 2016-17 campaign to begin this season 14-8. In the process, Detroit is securing come-from-behind victories with great frequency – half of its wins have occurred in games it trailed by double-digits – the second unit is dominating opposing benches and Andre Drummond is showcasing a vastly expanded offensive repertoire. Duncan Smith, contributor to The Athletic Detroit and Bball Breakdown, operates as our tour guide on this exhilarating exploration of the Motor City’s NBA club. We’ll discover how good the Pistons are and where they can still improve. Duncan’s game was clicking on all cylinders. Some highlights are excerpted below:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>6:09-7:03: “I think it’s concerning when your starting lineup can’t get you out to good starts, and you need your bench reserves, led by Ish Smith – everybody loves Ish Smith but he is one of the worst shooters in NBA history. When that’s what you’re relying on for stability, it’s a bit problematic, at the very least…When together, they just aren’t effective…I think that’s it’s going to have to be understood and dealt with before long.”<br><br>13:32-14:11: “It’s a complete and total shift. Basically everything that we thought we knew about Andre Drummond has kind of gone out the window. And I think that it really calls into question everything we thought about his ceiling. We don’t really know how good he can be anymore, and that’s really exciting too, because I think we kind of had an idea that maybe he would just be one of the best rebounders ever who also isn’t a huge drag on offense. I think that was kind of like our best-case scenario for him coming into the season. And now we see that he’s a pretty big plus offensively, while still being one of the best rebounders ever perhaps, and definitely, I would say, the best rebounder in the NBA today.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>17:32-18:02: “I think a big thing is he [Tobias Harris] is a lot quicker this season. That has had this synergistic effect with his 3-pointer, and it makes it so opposing 4s who are kind of trapped on an island with him on the perimeter, they really have to pick their poison. If they play up close on him, he can get around them with ease. If they give him a step, he’s really, really quick on that 3-point shot. His release has definitely quickened over the course of the last year.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>22:08-23:36: “He [Reggie Jackson] has just been better everywhere basically. The improvements on both ends, I think, have largely just come from getting his athleticism back…He is very much the old Reggie. And he’s able to play third or fourth fiddle on a team that I think league-wide a lot of people thought he had some character issues that would not allow him to be anything but the man. I think that he’s probably happier than he’s ever been on a team where he has to play third or fourth fiddle behind Andre Drummond, Tobias Harris and Avery Bradley.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>26:31-26:53: “I think part of the Pistons’ success in spite of slow starts and the starting lineup not being great has simply been the bench comes in and then they just mow the other bench to the ground. It’s often like an onslaught. Most nights, it looks like teams of two different tiers on the floor when the Pistons bench takes on another bench.” &nbsp;<br><br>37:28-38:49: “The Pistons hard-capped themselves at noon on July 1 for Langston Galloway, who provides you virtually nothing but shooting. Things like that are definitely problematic, but at the same time, you’ve got a guy [in Stan Van Gundy] who turns the shell of Brandon Jennings and Ersan Ilyasova into Tobias Harris…Van Gundy doesn’t lose trades, but he makes bad decisions on July 1…I think that he’s demonstrated some knack for the job in not selling low on Reggie Jackson or Andre Drummond, for example. These are things that definitely could’ve happened if Van Gundy wasn’t patient and taking a long view.” &nbsp;",

    "audio_length": 2045,
    "description_y": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We travel around a lot to different expos and shows, and what I love most about traveling around is hearing stories from everyone I meet. Sometimes their stories are touching, sometimes they leave me laughing, and sometimes they leave me scratching my head. One kind of story I hear a lot starts with, “Well all of a sudden, and for no reason…” and at that point my red flags are all shot up into the wind. There’s always a reason. So we’re diving into how our horses communicate with us and how we can better listen so it doesn’t seem like they’re acting out of nowhere.<o:p></o:p></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p><b> Key Takeaways</b></o:p></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Horses are incredibly honest, truly. They let us know when something is bothering them in most cases well in advance of acting “all of a sudden”. If we learn to pay attention to what they are telling us then we can address their issues before you end up hanging on for dear life as you’re drug across a pasture.<o:p></o:p></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Now don’t get me wrong. Things do happen all of a sudden, like a tree branch cracking and falling out of nowhere. Deer can be hidden in tall grass and bound away as you creep up on them. But it is in a horse’s nature to stay keenly aware. If you pay attention, you can feel a horse’s stride change just a little bit if they sense that something is off in their environment. Maybe they speed up, slow down, or tense up. When this happens just be alert, don’t cause the horse anymore stress. Keep a look out.<o:p></o:p></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Be aware of where you’re riding. Know what the possible scenarios that could lead your horse to be spooked or run off. For instance, if you’re driving through a neighborhood and see a “Kids at Play” sign, and then see children playing with a ball up ahead – you shouldn’t be surprised if that ball rolls out in front of your car as you drive by. You don’t have to stress about what could happen as you ride, but staying aware and knowing the risks can help you prevent scenarios where your horse bolts out of the blue.<o:p></o:p></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We also have to be aware of what we’re doing. It’s easy to blame an all of a sudden moment on the animals, but the fault can easily rest with us humans as well. Make sure you take the time to really analyze these moments if they occur and see if you did anything to prevent your horse from being set up for success. <o:p></o:p></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Have an “All of a sudden, for no reason…” story? Feel free to share! You can email Van at <a href=\"mailto:info@vanhargis.com\">info@vanhargis.com</a> and throw some more stories his way.<o:p></o:p></p>",

When something leaves you too soon, and you feel cheated (Barry Sanders comes to mind), you long for it again. That's Tiger Woods to me, so it's good to see El Tigre back hitting the stick (and not coming up lame... yet).\n\nLet me say this about Tennessee football, which is a complete shit-show and laughing stock right now, the hire of Phillip Fulmer to Athletic Director is the equivalent of Wisconsin hiring Barry Alvarez for the same position. The bloodshed was/is flowing in Knoxville, but the hiring of Fulmer is the bandage they desparately needed. \n\nJimbo Fisher to A&M ($7.5 mil/per!!!!!!!!!!).. Scott Frost to Nebraska (Reunion time).. Chip Kelly to UCLA.. and more. The college football coaching carousel is humming!\n\n5 Weeks left in the NFL, and starting this week, shit gets real. The Cowboys already kept their playoff hopes alive by putting a whoopin on the Redskins, and that was just the appetizer for a loaded Week 5. The NFC is flat out ridiculous with Falcons v. Vikings.. Saints v. Panthers.. and Seahawks v. Eagles.. The Steelers and Patriots don't have gimmes having to go on the road to the 'Natti and Buffalo, respectively. \n\nSo much to get to, so little time. \"Shirts v.

Well, I'm not sure \"former\" LA Galaxy midfielder and captain, Jermaine Jones, ever had that problem. And Jones' calm rant on his Instagram live show will give us plenty to talk about. \n\nOn today's show, your host Josh Guesman will, of course, have his reaction to Jones' inflammatory comments and why he seems to be coming about this with something that is the complete opposite of true. Do Galaxy fans only care about big name players? Does the city at large only care about big name players? Is there a difference when talking about supporters? Or is this all just one big misunderstanding? We'll get to the bottom of it for sure. \n\nBut first, Josh will tell you about three former Galaxy players who could be available and why the Galaxy might want to look in their direction when it comes to filling some of the 17 roster spots that are still open. Do the names Sean Franklin, Marcelo Sarvas, and Juninho send shivers up your spine? Then you'll want to listen and weigh-in on whether or not they should return to the club. \n\nAnd of course, our featured guest on this offseason podcast is good-friend of the show Brian Dunseth. Dunny will talk about the LA Galaxy's failure of a season and why it's an especially large blow to the Galaxy's reputation in player development. If you were a Galaxy prospect, would you be eying LAFC across the hall? \n\nIt's a great discussion about the Galaxy and some of the big mistakes that were made or the talent that was misidentified on this roster over the years. \n\nNot bad for an offseason podcast with little to talk about. We hope this podcast gets you into that December feeling and we'll be back soon with more of the very best Galaxy content we can muster. \n\nMusic Provided by Back Pocket Memory",

I then release these reviews in podcast form with only minor edits for clarity and excess background noise.\n\nThe basic philosophy of this show is that the initial impression you get of a film is often the most accurate one.\n\nThis podcast is not released on any schedule. In each episode there are two of these raw reviews and I will release a show as soon as I have two reviews stored up. Since I go to the cinema a lot the show will usually be weekly, but there could be weeks where there is more than one show released and other weeks where no show is released.\n\nThis version is the standard mp3 version of the podcast",

Konsole auf dem Markt. Microsofts Xbox musste sich schon lange Sony geschlagen geben, aber nun haben die Redmonder in der Tat ein sehr edles Stück Hardware veröffentlicht. Wir haben die neue Konsole für Euch getestet. </p>\n<h2>Sicherheitslücken und Fehler in High Sierra</h2>\n<p><span id=\"more-634\"></span></p>\n<p>Sehr gut, dass wir nur alle zwei Wochen eine Folge machen, so konnten wir diesmal die Fehler und Sicherheitslücken sammeln. </p>\n<h3>Root Zugriff ohne Passwort</h3>\n<p>In einigen Versionen ist der Benutzer Root angelegt, hat aber kein Passwort. Das ermöglicht unmittelbaren und uneingeschränkten Zugriff auf das System. Apple hat dafür bereits einen Patch eingespielt. Dieser musste bei der Installation nicht bestätigt werden, aber Kontrolle ist ja immer besser. So könnt ihr es ausprobieren:<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPsUM48H4MY\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h3>Der böse 2. Dezember</h3>\n<p>Offenbar haben einige Computersysteme ein Problem mit dem 2. Dezember 2017. iOS war betroffen, aber das Update 11.2 <a href=\"http://www.maclife.de/news/macos-high-sierra-vom-datums-bug-betroffen-10098387.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">behebt den Fehler</a>. Nun schient es aber auch so zu sein, dass High Sierra davon betroffen ist. Das äußert sich zum Glück nicht in einem Systemabsturz oder einer Endlosschleife, aber es kann dadurch sehr langsam werden. Wir warten auf ein Update &#8211; und wenn euer Rechner seit kurzem sehr langsam ist, dann wisst ihr jetzt wieso. </p>\n<h2>Call of Duty World War II und Star Wars Battlefront II</h2>\n<p>Wie jeden Winter ballern (im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes) die Publisher Ihre neuen Games raus. Wir haben 2 der wichtigsten Shooter Titel dieser Saison für Euch durchgespielt und getestet. Wie ist die Kampagne, die Grafik und v.a. der Multiplayer?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm8ImF1wGsw\">Call of Duty</a></p>\n<h2>Neues Eminem Album am 15.12.</h2>\n<p>Lange war es still im den weißen Rapper aus Detroit doch nun kommt schon am 15.12. sein 9. Studioalbum &#8220;Revival&#8221; auf dem Markt. Mit Ed Sheeran, Beyoncé sind nicht nur Rapper am Start und die erste Single scheint schon etwas ernstere Töne anzuschlagen.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8061624/eminem-revival-track-list\">Walk on Water</a></p>\n<h2>Serientipps</H2><br />\nDark, die neue Netflix Produktion &#8211; mit Zeitreise.</p>\n<h2>KI Galore</H2><br />\nViele spannende neue KI getrieben Dienste werden gestartet bzw. sind in Zukunft dazu da, unser Leben zu vereinfachen. Amazon startet mit Rekognition einen Analysedienst auf AWS Basis und Adobe nutzt die Cloud um die Arbeit von Grafikern einfacher zu machen.</p>\n<h2>Slaughter Bots &#8211; finstere Version der Zukunft</h2>\n<p>Killerbots? Eine Vorstufe davon haben wir schon, mit der wir ferngesteuert Menschen töten. Doch was wäre, wenn die Roboter, gefüttert mit Big Data nun anfangen würden, Ziele selbst zu identifizieren und anzugreifen? Der <a href=\"http://autonomousweapons.org/slaughterbots/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Film Slaughter Bots</a> von Autonomousweapons.org zeigt, wie das laufen könnte.</p>\n<h2>Durchbruch in der Akkutechnologie</h2>\n<p>Die Frage ist, ob man <a href=\"http://www.chip.de/news/Samsung-gelingt-der-Durchbruch-Akkus-laden-jetzt-fuenfmal-schneller_128402476.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung</a> vertrauen will, wenn es um Neuigkeiten bei der Leistungsfähigkeit von Akkus geht. Ihnen ist es jetzt gelungen, die Kapazität von Lithium Ionen Akkus deutlich zu erhöhen und das bei schnelleren Ladezeiten. Marktreif ist die Technologie noch nicht, aber es verspricht viel für die Zukunft. Solange sie nicht wieder in die Luft fliegen&#8230;.</p>\n<h2>Filmtipp: Valerian</h2>\n<p>Lange galt der Comic &#8220;Valerian und Veronique&#8221; als nicht verfilmbar. Luc Besson hatte sich die Rechte gekauft und das Projekt in jahrelanger Arbeit umgesetzt. Herausgekommen ist ein spaßiger, bombastischer Sci-Fi Film der einen doch immer wieder mit Tiefgang überrascht.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8kFeUp3TG4\">Valerian</a></p>\n<h2>VR/AR Ecke</h2>\n<p>Und hier haben wir mal alle VR und AR Themen für euch an einer Stelle</p>\n<h3>So viele Headsets</h3>\n<p>Kurzmeldung: <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/27/vr-headsets-pass-1-million-shipments-for-the-first-time-in-a-single-quarter/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">VR Headset Verkäufe</a> brechen zum ersten mal die 1 Mio Marke in einem Quartal. </p>\n<h3>Gerüchte um Apple und AR</h3>\n<p>Es scheint, als würde Apple Gas geben in Sachen Augmented Reality. Das zumindest meldet <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-08/apple-is-said-to-ramp-up-work-on-augmented-reality-headset\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a>. Ein eigenes Headset könnte 2020 in den Handel kommen. </p>\n<h3>HTC mit Standalone AR Headset</h3>\n<p>Gut ist die HTC Vive ja ohne Frage. Blöd nur, dass man immer am Kabel hängt oder gleich ein Laptop umschnallen muss, um damit mobilen Spaß zu haben. Das könnte sich jetzt mit der <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/14/16648112/htc-vive-focus-standalone-headset-announced-daydream-cancelled\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Vive Focus</a> ändern. Mit integriertem Google Daydream und der Basis, die schon an Vive kompatibler Software besteht ist das sicher das praktischte und vielseitigste mobile Setup, das man bekommen kann. Derzeit soll das Gerät aber nur in China auf den Markt kommen. Preis und Release Date unbekannt. Na da sind wir mal gespannt&#8230;</p>\n<p>Der Beitrag <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sag-was.com/geektalk/volles-spektrum-episode-149/\">Volles Spektrum &#8211; Episode 149</a> erschien zuerst auf <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sag-was.com/geektalk\">Sag was!

The new mic starts at \"Tom Hanks is in a horror movie.\"\n\nRegular Podcasters: \n\nLindsey Clark -  Lindsey Clark graduated from Illinois State University with a degree in Journalism. She is currently putting that degree to great use by working at a bank. Her hobbies include reading, canoeing, trying new restaurants and pal-lin’ around. She joined the IT Records podcast in November 2016 and her top horror flicks are Scream (1996), Suspiria (1977) and IT (2017).  Her guilty pleasure will forever be the 1998 cinematic phenomenon that is Urban Legend.\n \nMatt Johnson - Matt Johnson graduated from Illinois State University with a degree in Journalism and Renewable Energy. He earned a minor in Cinema Studies and utilizes the knowledge from those courses for the enrichment of the IT Records podcast. He currently is working toward a master’s degree in Sustainability  and Energy Economics. When he isn’t working at the university, he enjoys reading, exercising, and sipping a nice Malbec. A few of his favorite movies include Suspiria (1977), Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), and Eyes Without A Face (1962). He has a guilty pleasure for the 1998 film starring Scrubs’ Sarah Chalke, I’ve Been Waiting For You. \n\nPeter Hansen - Peter Hansen graduated from Illinois State University with a degree in Television Production.  He is in every way the bizarro Matt Johnson. Peter never drinks coffee or reads books. He is shorter than Matt and better looking.  Sure, he can be lazy, use terrible grammar, and procrastinate, but nonetheless he is trying to make a career with the degree he earned through blood, sweat, and tears.  A list of films Peter loves include The Thing (1982), Rec (2007) and Peeping Tom (1962). Pete has a guilty pleasure for the tasty Junior Mint and the Stephen King directed film, Maximum Overdrive. He has been quoted saying the film is “simply divine.”",

Press #1 to speak\n\nIs Sexual Harassment becoming Trivialized?\n\nThis week allegations of sexual harassment against another democratic elected official have been made.  The range is from freshmen congressmen, a former comedian to the dean of Congress.  There has been a major awareness initiative called #MeToo that has acted as a wave over the country.  Many entertainers and business leaders have stepped down or have been fired.  Matt Lauer was fired Tuesday.  Prior to him it was Bill O’Reilly and others in the news media.  It seems to be a low tolerance for it in the business and entertainment world but not so much in the political arena.  In spite of calls for resignations most are still there from the President to the latest Congressperson. Are politicians serious when they call for another to resign or maybe it’s just political cover?  It seems that our moral compass is rolling back due to political tribalism that has run a muck!  Is this really a big moment for sexual harassment victims or is Sexual Harassment becoming Trivialized?\n\nIf you have a question, comment or just want to listen, give us a call: (347) 826-9600.

This week Cheryl, Wendy and Shar talk about the health hacks they&#8217;ve found have helped to calm the chaos, stay sane (sort of) and keep our bodies and minds working well. It can be hard to put self-care on the top of your Priority List, but it&#8217;s vital. From mindfulness to stretching, gratitude to social media-strangling, we hope you&#8217;ll find our healthy hacks helpful. As a wise commercial says, <em>you&#8217;re worth it</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>1)        Mindfulness</strong></p>\n<p>According to mindfulness teacher, Jon Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness is “the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally, to the unfolding of experience moment to moment”.</p>\n<p>It’s not magic, or mysterious. It’s simply focussing on what you’re doing when you’re doing it, <em>without </em>thinking about anything else.  Turning our brain “off” isn’t the goal here – what we’re aiming to do is practice being present.  This slows down the monkey chatter going on it your head and it’s particularly helpful when you’re writing (helps that negative self talk shut up) and when you’re editing and proofreading (focus, grasshopper). If a pesky thought enters your head, distracting you, you “observe” it with detachment.</p>\n<p>A clear and focussed mind is a beautiful thing, and there’s a reason this is called a “practice” – ie it’s something you need to consciously do throughout the day!  One app many of us have tried is Headspace.com which is guided meditation.</p>\n<p>Other mindfulness app recommendations here: <a href=\"https://www.mindful.org/free-mindfulness-apps-worthy-of-your-attention/\">https://www.mindful.org/free-mindfulness-apps-worthy-of-your-attention/</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2)        Water </strong></p>\n<p>Pure H20 – the stuff you splash in with your whiskey doesn’t count.</p>\n<p>Keep a bottle by your desk and stay hydrated. Side benefit: all the getting up and going to the bathroom enforces you to get off your chair!</p>\n<p><strong>3)        Fresh Air / Exercise</strong></p>\n<p>Fresh air (for mental and physical health) is vital every day. We all know the benefits of exercise – the key we’ve found is to find something you enjoy (eg walk while listening to podcasts) and change things up so you’re not bored.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>4)        Healthy Fuel</strong></p>\n<p>Not going to get into dietary advice, except to say “stop eating crap” and remember that to function well your brain and body need good fats and protein.  No secret that many of the top tier of romance writers we met at RWA over the years pay good attention to their health and wellness. We’re in this for the long haul people!  Ass-spread as a result of sitting is a very real danger. As is heart disease, diabetes and a host of other illnesses.  You’re a Ferrari Of Awesomeness – give yourself the right fuel to run.</p>\n<p><strong>5)        Healthy Sleep Habits</strong></p>\n<p>Who hasn’t lain awake at night wrangling plot problems in their head? But poor sleep can have a really negative impact on your health and your writing, so it’s worth paying as much attention to your healthy sleeping as it is when you’re awake.  Consider: bed time routines, exercise / fresh air, healthy food to aid sleep, magnesium and other natural supplements, turning off “blue light” devices before bed.  Many writers struggle with depression and anxiety of which poor sleep is a symptom.  Courage is asking for help, no need to suffer alone.</p>\n<p>Our fellow podcasters James Blatch and Mark Dawson had an excellent episode with sleep expert Dr Anne Bartolucci which is well worth a listen at: <a href=\"https://selfpublishingformula.com/episode-76/\">https://selfpublishingformula.com/episode-76/</a></p>\n<p><strong>6)        Trim back on Social Media</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Especially at this time of year, social media, holiday stress and buy-buy-buy emails can be really anxiety-inducing. This is where tips we’ve talked about previously can help. In our Author Overwhelm book, we suggest:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Understand what you’re trying to achieve by using social media </em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take a step back and look at your overall social media strategy. Do you want to engage with fans? Do you want to meet other authors to find cross promotion buddies? Or do you want to just sell more books? Each of these aims would require a very different social media strategy. Once again, as soon as you have a specific goal in mind it becomes easier to decide what actions to take, and where to spend your time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Pick one social media platform to learn at a time </em></p>\n<p><em>Pick Facebook first </em></p>\n<p><em>Limit your daily social media activity</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This means only looking at certain times of the day. And turn off your Facebook feed between those times. You’ll only get sucked into a cute kitten/sexy-firemen-holding-puppies time-warp that will steal your writing time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Consider scheduling posts and other automation assistance</em></p>\n<p><em>Plan ahead and stay focused </em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you think you might be spending too much time on social media, it could be from lack of planning. If you don’t know how much you want to do, and how often, you can sometimes overdose because of the guilt from not doing as much as you think you should. If you have a clear plan, and you know on a week-to-week basis exactly what you need to have on your social media platform, it will be much more streamlined and effective. The temptation not to plan because you think it takes too long is a false economy (but for time, not money).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>If you can’t do it regularly, don’t do it at all </em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This applies to blogging most of all, but also to social media platforms. If you can’t give your audience what they need, perhaps it’s time to rethink your strategy. Honestly, the world will not fall apart if you’re not on Twitter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Try taking a social media vacation</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the same as above, but less permanent. Try just having a break for a while. Trying to keep up with all the posts, retweets, and must-haves on social media can be tiring. Sometimes you just need to step back and take a break. You can use automation to keep a presence, but take yourself out of it for a month.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>7)        Be Grateful</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, we know Gratitude Journals, a la Gwyneth Paltrow and Oprah, can seem just one more darn “thing to do” but keeping the spirit / creative well / mind healthy is key to writing success, just as much as upping your marketing game or nailing tropes. This is an amazing, awesome time to be a writer and it’s easy to forget that when we’re lost in the fog of To Dos and If Onlys.</p>\n<p>A team of researchers from the University of Limerick’s study published in 2017 found gratitude journaling had a significant, positive impact on well-being. Interestingly, those who were more depressed got the most benefit out of expressing their gratitude.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/think-act-be/201703/why-is-gratitude-in-relationships-so-beneficial\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/think-act-be/201703/why-is-gratitude-in-relationships-so-beneficial</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/gratitude-journal/\">https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/gratitude-journal/</a></p>\n<p><strong>8)        Ya Gotta Laugh</strong></p>\n<p>When we spoke with screenwriter Kathryn Burnett last episode, she reminded us of her sign than overcomes her resistance and helps ground her: it says, <em>you will die.</em>   Which we all laughed at (a bit uncomfortably at fast) but that is SO true. And in the same way, laughing at your current (writing) situation is a huge stress release. Even the crazed cackling at 2am when Amazon won’t upload your darn cover image.</p>\n<p>Humor not only helps with stress, it also has physical benefits (apparently a hearty laugh benefits your circulation, lungs and tummy muscles!) as well as boosting your creativity.</p>\n<p><strong>9)        Stretch Yourself</strong></p>\n<p>Not just mentally, but physically. Take care of your back, your neck and your hands (dictation is worth mastering).  Try Pilates (Wendy), Essentrics : <a href=\"http://www.essentrics.com/media.html\">http://www.essentrics.com/media.html</a>  (Shar) and read our <a href=\"http://www.selfpublishingauthorspodcast.com/authoroverwhelm/\">Author Overwhelm</a> book for more exercises and tips.</p>\n<p><strong>10)       Anxiety</strong></p>\n<p>Can be a friend and a foe.  Our previous podcast guest, Melissa Storm, talked about turning it into her Superpower (<a href=\"http://www.selfpublishingauthorspodcast.com/spa-girls-podcast-interview-with-melissa-storm-what-your-readers-really-want/\">Spa Girls Podcast Episode #109</a>). When a foe, it can be crippling, and many writers suffer. Getting some kind of help is vital – see your doctor, therapist, natural health practitioner and talk to other writers. You are not alone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "description_y": "We’re back baby! Manga Mavericks has been on a hiatus recently, but we’ve returned to end the year with a bang. That’s right, since 2017 is over, it’s time to look back at the last year of manga and highlight the best of the best. First we’ve got an hour and a half of news highlights from the past three months, giving our thoughts on some of the most important news stories we missed. Except for licensing news, because trying to recap everything Seven Seas has licensed this year would take a whole show in of itself. After that, it’s our best of manga superlative awards, where we gush about our favorite things about manga this year, and reminisce about our favorite moments from the podcast as well. It’s four hours of Manga Mavericks goodness to close out 2017 and begin 2018 strong!\n\nWe want to thank everyone who listened and contributed to our podcasts this year. This was a big year for both the podcast and our personal lives, the latter of which resulting in the former being put on hiatus for the past couple of months. The podcast really grew this year as we tackled excellent topics like “The Future of Shonen Jump” and “The State of Shonen Sunday,” and we had guests from the manga industry on like Annaliese Christman and Jeff Ruberg. Manga Mavericks @ Movies debuted this year giving us a fun outlet to talk about movies with friends like Ethan and Jonathan, the latter of which also joining us for my favorite project we did this year – The Pokemon Adventures retrospectives. Not to mention we launched our Youtube channel early in the year, which finally surpassed the 100 subscriber threshold in November and continues to grow. It’s really incredible just how much we accomplished with the show this year even with our short hiatus, and we think 2018 is going to be an even better year for us. We have lots of ideas and topics for the show set and scheduled, as well as exciting projects we can’t wait to start working on. So there’s a lot to look forward to in 2018!\n\nBut wait, there’s a way you guys can help make the show better too! By taking our annual year-end survey, you can give us feedback that’ll help us curate the content of our show to reflect what our audience most responds too. We take your suggestions and feedback very seriously, and want to figure out more ways to reach our and interact with you guys, so please leave some responses! As always, you can also e-mail us at mangamavericks@gmail.com with any questions or suggestions you have as well! \n\nEnjoy the show, and follow us on twitter at @manga_mavericks, on tumblr at mangamavericks.tumblr.com,and now on Youtube! You can also follow the hosts at @sniperking323 and @lumranmayasha. If you’d like to help support the show financially you can donate to Colton’s Ko-fi here and LumRanmaYasha’s Ko-fi here. Don’t forget to also like and subscribe to us on Youtube and iTunes and leave us reviews to help us curate the show and create better content! On our next episode we’ll be reviewing Sket Dance to celebrate it’s 10th anniversary (no seriously, we’re really doing it this time – I swear!). If you have any questions or topics concerning Sket Dance that you’d like us to discuss, you can drop us a line in the comments below, comment in the Manga Mavericks thread on Animation Revelation, tweet at us, or send an e-mail! As always, thanks for listening, and I hope you all have a very Happy New Year!<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MangaMavericks/~4/WfDs9kn5VWg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

It&#8217;s a difficult, emotional period for anyone involved with a divorce. See <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WZC6YXlFKqs\">here our video</a>.<br />\nThere are many financial issues when people are separating their lives:<br />\nDividing property – including:<br />\n<br />\n* Retirement plans<br />\n* Pensions<br />\n* Employer retirement plans<br />\n* Health savings accounts<br />\n* Annuities<br />\n* Brokerage accounts<br />\n* Dividing debt<br />\n* Making sure both parties have insurance<br />\n* Retirement planning<br />\n* Custody of children<br />\n* Evaluating estate plans<br />\n<br />\nThere is so much uncertainty and so many issues to deal with all at an emotional period.<br />\nTax Issues for Divorce<br />\nFor this episode, I interview Amy Wall, an Enrolled Agent, which means she is licensed by the IRS to represent taxpayers in tax matters. She has a degree in Economics and an MBA. She has a tax practice at <a href=\"http://tucsontaxteam.com/\">Tucson Tax Team</a>. After going through her own divorce about a decade ago, she got very interested in divorce taxation and has even published a small book on the subject called Divorce and Taxes: What you should know before you sign. Available on Amazon.<br />\nSome of the topics that we cover in our interview include:<br />\n• What are your filing status options in the year when the divorce was finalized?<br /><br />\n• What is involved in filing Married Filing Single (MFS) in a community property state?<br /><br />\n• How does tax planning factor into divorce settlements?<br /><br />\n• How is the split of assets taxed? Real estate and accounts.<br /><br />\n• How are taxes calculated on retirement accounts? and on capital gains?<br /><br />\n• What can you expect for taxes after divorce? For partners who earn about the same and for unequal earners?<br /><br />\n• How is alimony taxed and deducted?  Who gets the benefit?<br /><br />\n• How is child support taxed?<br /><br />\n• What are common pitfalls for divorcing couples?<br />\nThank you – what is the best way for people to get in touch with you<br />\nShe can be reached at 520-777-7844 or at amy@tucsontaxteam.com.<br />",

It&#8217;s a wander that involves buses, tiny breweries, Google definitions, and the delicate art of crashing a Christmas party for a Boxing club. It also explores the incredible amount of 4 Pines Breweries in Sydney, and may well confirm our dream of bringing back the fabled Guava Gose from the aforementioned brewery.</p>\n<p>And if that wasn&#8217;t enough, we talk about Chris&#8217; love of the Modus Operandi Red IPA, the Former Tenant, discuss the first time we drank it, and reluctantly let Chris talk excessively about his complimentary article about the beer in <a href=\"http://frothbeer.com/\">Froth Craft Beer Magazine</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Featured beers:</strong> Sonic Prayer, Former Tenant, and Future Factory by <a href=\"http://www.mobrewing.com.au/\">Modus Operandi Brewing Co.</a></p>",

After funding itself for its first 8 years with less than $5 million of total venture capital, CarGurus took its $200 million business to the public markets in October at $16/share, raising $150 million customer acquisition war chest on the back of a $1.7 Billion enterprise valuation. After beating estimates for Q3, the stock sits today around $30/share, representing a market cap of over $3.2 Billion. To call their exit a home run would be a massive understatement, and Jason Trevisan was at the center of it.\n\nThis will be Jason’s first big interview since the end of their quiet period, and to set expectations we did NOT talk very much about the business. My focus as always was on Jason’s personal journey, which began at Duke and ran through Bain & Company, a stint at online advertising leader aQuantive until it was acquired by Microsoft, and an extended stay as a VC at Polaris Partners, a Boston VC firm focused on growth equity investments and buyouts in Internet, technology and healthcare.",

And given their history with hurricanes, both knew that preparing their people was their top priority.\n\nFor Swink, hurricanes are deeply personal. The mention of the word takes her thoughts and emotions back to 2004, when her family’s home took a direct hit from Hurricane Ivan.\n\nSwink and Suarez paint a vivid picture of the Hurricane Irma – with the full force of fierce winds, torrential rain and incredible outpouring of compassion that came with it.",

Salinger wrote, “It’s really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirs,” which implies that a mismatch of everything from money to values to stylistic tastes to distaste for doing the dishes can make for a fraught co-existence.</p>\n<p>And then there’s the monthly joust over who is or isn’t paying their share of the rent and utilities on time.</p>\n<p>Technology has proven useful in eliminating the friction inherent in so many processes and online marketplaces, so why not the process of finding a roommate where co-existence is virtually guaranteed to be harmonious?</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://roomiapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roomi</a>, a startup peer-to-peer marketplace that provides a way to match those seeking shared housing with those offering the same. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/13/roomi-raises-11-million-to-find-you-a-roommate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">As announced in November</a>, the company raised $11 million in Series A funding, culled from the London-based Atami Capital, with the participation of several other firms.</p>\n<p>Roomi counts one million users among its registered base and 250,000 rooms on its platform. Total funding to date is about $17 million. The roster of cities tops 21, and the most active locales, as CEO Ajay Yadav told PYMNTS’ Karen Webster in the latest Topic TBD, include New York and San Francisco. The latest capital raised will bring London onto the roster.</p>\n<p>The key features of the platform, via both app and website, are that apartment listings are searchable and that tenants have been background-checked by the company.</p>\n<p>Yadav told Webster that the inefficient methods of matching spaces and tenants – where notes on bulletin boards and classified ads on craigslist and other sites search blindly for applicants, or would-be tenants search blindly for rooms – “have been around for decades.”</p>\n<p>In essence, he said (and in his own experience), we’ve all been stuck “sending e-mails to people I do not know anything about … the personality or roommate information was missing,” and finding a true fit in terms of personality or values stood as hit-or-miss efforts.</p>\n<p>Roomi, he said, is geared toward the young professional who has experience in the shared economy, using sites and apps like <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/sizzlefizzle/2017/ubers-bad-year-plus-amazon-pay-cannabis-and-wells-fargo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Uber</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2017/airbnb-offers-payment-splitting-for-group-rentals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Airbnb</a>, trafficking in data and trust that encompass information taken from sources as far-flung as Facebook and employment verification efforts.</p>\n<p>“We think we can bring the trust back to the marketplace by verifying identities, by creating profiles, by doing background checks on people and also by asking for a lot of information, said Yadav. &#8220;By using LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and lifestyle preference questions,” a full picture emerges of who might be settling in – and who you really might not want to darken your door.</p>\n<p>Conversely, the person offering the shared space provides information about the room, along with pictures and the stated preferences of the ideal type of roommate.</p>\n<p>Roomi acts as the middleman, so to speak, as listings and “house rules” can be created in minutes. As Yadav said, listing approval by the company includes efforts to find out if people actually live there, with requests for copies of the lease or deed. These, along with fee-based <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2015/running-a-background-check-for-businesses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">background checks</a> designed to weed out bad actors, all work as ways to “ask everyone to play by the rules so we can all trust each other,” he said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://roomiapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roomi</a> profiles get as granular as whether applicants or those looking for tenants are self-described “foodies,&#8221; whether they like walks on the beach on Sundays, and if yoga is a way of life or biking everywhere is a true joy (and, in some cases, whether, ahem, recreational drug use is a-ok).</p>\n<p>The idea is to enjoy a given city more, said Yadav, with the sweetener of living with people who enjoy like-minded activities – and where co-habitation may have layers of shared experiences beyond simply breathing the same oxygen.</p>\n<p>The app fosters the creation of personality profiles (some of which seem a little too reminiscent of dating profiles), and lets would-be roommates text each other to see if chemistry is there.</p>\n<p>All of this takes place against a background where demographic and economic shifts have been driving younger generations to shared living experiences. <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/subscription-commerce/2017/millennials-opt-for-with-furniture-subscriptions-via-feather/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Millennials</a> and others (the company’s average user is in his or her mid-20s) among professional cohorts are, as Yadav put it, “looking for better opportunities all the time.”</p>\n<p>Most people do not stay at companies for more than three years – as he said, “If I get a job in Chicago and in four or six months I am unhappy, I am going to leave.” So it is as they move from city to city, from job to job. And even within the same company, there can be a bit of hopscotch. Think of <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2017/google-wants-to-help-users-hire-the-right-expert/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google</a>, where people may go from an office in New York to London or Bangalore.</p>\n<p>In that true transient experience, he said, “you can’t rent an Airbnb, you cannot go to a hotel. The company is not going to support you for a very long time.”</p>\n<p>Future plans include the aforementioned expansion to London, additional listings in extant cities and for a ratings system to be deployed, Yadav told Webster, along with escrow services for rent deposits.</p>\n<p>“You do want to get to know people if you are going to be living in those random cities, and we believe that everyone should be able to move anywhere and feel at home.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

He explains how a form of offset can benefit African nations if they take the leap to try it. However, it is just one strategy, and African leaders must look for solutions wherever they can find them. They should set ambitious goals; even if they fall a little short, any improvement would be better than none.\n\nFor more Unleash Africa, follow us on Twitter @AfricaUnleashed, on Facebook @UnleashAfricanTrade, on LinkedIn, and subscribe to our newsletter at www.unleashafricantrade.com",

My name is Tim Peter, today is Thursday, December 14, 2017 and this is episode 206 of the big show. Thank you so much for tuning in. I really do appreciate you hanging with me during the last handful of weeks. The show&#39;s been a little bit more irregular, but I will be back next week, then will be off the week after that &mdash; I&#8217;ll be taking a break for Christmas &mdash; and then starting up again full-time in the New Year with weekly episodes coming to you, so I appreciate you hanging around. I appreciate you coming back and listening to the show; I&#8217;m just really happy that you&#39;re here. </p>\n<h3>What Digital Means for the Future of Brands &#8211; Overview</h3>\n<p>Now I think we&#8217;ve got a really interesting show this week. There&#39;s some really cool stuff to talk about. And I want to start by talking about a bunch of random companies that have something in common. You may not have realized it, maybe you did, but you know if you haven&#8217;t, just think this through for second. Think about companies like eBay or Etsy or Yelp or Uber or Airbnb. What they all share in common is that they&#8217;re all ratings platform. They allowed people to post ratings and reviews and the like that makes it clear whether you want to do business with the person on the other side of that market. And I think that&#39;s critically important to understand in terms of how you&#39;re going to market your brand and how you market your business as you go forward into 2018 and beyond because, fundamentally, what were seeing from people like eBay, Easy, Yelp, Uber, Airbnb, and others is that they&#39;re going to destroy brands, at least in the traditional sense. At their most basic they&#8217;re challenging what the purpose of the brand is, what brands do for customers. And that&#39;s really important understand. </p>\n<p>Now you&#39;ve probably heard David Ogilvy&#39;s famous quote, &#8220;a brand is a promise.&#8221; You may even have heard it here; it&#39;s one that I&#8217;ve referred to many times. It&#8217;s such a crucial insight about why brands exist. Brands served as a proxy for trust. If you go back to some idyllic, 1950&#8217;s holiday with the family driving along Route 66 wouldn&#8217;t know where to eat, sleep, or get gasoline once they ventured too far from home. They only knew the products and the services in their local area. But if you put a McDonald&#39;s or Ramada or a Phillips 66 along the highway, the family was quite literally good to go. </p>\n<p>Today? Your brand is only as good as your last review.</p>\n<p>Were those products or those services luxurious? No. But that wasn&#39;t the point. They were <em>consistent</em>. The brand provided a proxy for trust. You didn&#39;t need to care about the individual restaurant, or the individual hotel, or the individual gas station. You could trust the brand. Again in Ogilvy&#8217;s terms, &#8220;a brand is a promise.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Today? Well your brand is only as good as your last review. </p>\n<h3>What Digital Means for the Future of Brands &#8211; The Importance of Reviews</h3>\n<p>A generation ago, would you have willingly gotten into a stranger&#39;s car when he pulled up in front of you at the airport, or slept in someone else&#39;s home who you had never met, or &mdash; and credit where due to eBay here &mdash; bought someone&#8217;s used junk over the Internet? How could you be sure you&#8217;d receive the goods or the seller wouldn&#8217;t just take off of with your money or, God forbid, with the car or the house, something really terrible wouldn&#39;t have happened to you? If you think about things like classified ads or even Craigslist, they really just served a local area and depended on face-to-face interactions to complete the transaction. </p>\n<p>Yes, you could get a lot of details, but once it was time to buy, you typically met with somebody face-to-face. And to be fair, things like vacation rentals have existed for years, but they really only represented a sliver of the market.</p>\n<p>But now there are companies like Airbnb, companies like Uber, companies like Yelp and they&#8217;re becoming the dominant players in their respective industries. And if you think about the larger players the <a href=\"http://www.timpeter.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aW1wZXRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wNi8wNi90aGlua3Mtb3V0LWxvdWQtZXBpc29kZS0zMC10aGUtcmlzZS1vZi1hZ2ZhbS1hcHBsZS1nb29nbGUtZmFjZWJvb2stYW1hem9uLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1hbmQtZXZlcnl3aGVyZS1zaG9wcGluZy8%3D&#038;feed-stats-url-post-id=7186\">AGFAM folks (or, if you prefer, the &#8220;Frightful Five,&#8221;) Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft,</a> a lot of their success depends on that same thing.</p>\n<p>If you think about Amazon, first as a bookstore and now as this complete e-commerce platform with independent sellers, fundamentally it depends on its ratings and reviews. eBay may have laid the groundwork but Amazon undoubtedly owns that space today. If you think about the Apple App Store or Google Play store, they serve very much the same function for apps or, oh I don&#39;t know, podcasts and things along those lines. You know, if you&#39;re like most people, if you&#39;re looking for a new utility to improve your productivity or or you&#39;re looking for something to provide you entertainment and information, I suspect you venture to the appropriate app store, you conduct a quick search, and then you choose the highest-rated app, or the highest-rated podcast, or the highest-rated movie or TV show that meets your needs. And we&#8217;re seeing this start to completely upend the traditional brand landscape that we&#39;ve known for years. </p>\n<p>For instance, take a look at McDonald&#8217;s. Now they&#8217;ve been having some troubles lately, and it&#39;s certainly true that healthier eating habits have taken a toll on the restaurant giant. But there&#39;s also no question that Yelp also did a number on Mickey D&#8217;s. Why would you choose the same old burger and fries when you have other healthier, tastier options and support some local business as well? To McDonald&#39;s credit they&#8217;re working really hard to revitalize their offerings and to make them more attractive to diners. And they&#8217;re starting to see some positive results. But there&#39;s little doubt in my mind that the local review scene has absolutely caused them some issues. </p>\n<p>We talked about some of this a few weeks back in the episode <a href=\"http://www.timpeter.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aW1wZXRlci5jb20vMjAxNy8wMy8yOS9jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLWlzLXF1ZWVuLXdoYXQtZG9lcy10aGF0LW1lYW4tdGhpbmtzLW91dC1sb3VkLWVwaXNvZGUtMTkwLw%3D%3D&#038;feed-stats-url-post-id=7186\">&#8220;Customer Experience is Queen, What Does That Mean?&#8221;</a> because it really impacts how people perceive your products and services and brings others to the fore who might have been seen as a competitor before. </p>\n<h3>What Digital Means for the Future of Brands &#8211; Impacts to Business Models</h3>\n<p>It&#39;s also changing business models dramatically. Now I think most longtime listeners know I do a fair bit of work in the hospitality industry and there&#39;s a very stark example there. In the hospitality industry we&#8217;re seeing a lot of what are called soft brands, where hotel owners use the platform provided by major chains but not the brand itself. </p>\n<p>So most of these hotels tend to be franchised and instead of opening a new Marriott Hotel a real estate investor would open an independent hotel, call it whatever they want &mdash; the New York City Excelsior, right? &mdash; but they receive some support from Marriott behind the scenes. Almost every major hotel hotel chain has launched one or more of these over the last few years. Hilton with its Curio Collection and The Tapestry Collection, and Marriott with the Autograph Collection, the Luxury Collection, and the Tribute Portfolio have five between the two of them. Why? Because hotel owners demanded the ability to create a distinct experience in their local markets while still having access to the rewards programs that are so prominent and so powerful within the hospitality and lodging industries. </p>\n<p>The question is how long will it be before that&#39;s all Marriott, Hilton, and their competitors provide to hotel owners at all — or worse find that technology platforms like Expedia, Airbnb, and others have taken their place?</p>\n<p>You know, years ago these two authors, Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian, a couple of economists, wrote this wonderful and extraordinary book called <em>Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy</em> and they explained that digital only provides two avenues for success: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can either become the dominant firm in an industry or, </li>\n<li>You can become a differentiated product </li>\n</ol>\n<p>But anything else is gonna hurt you. Ben Thompson at Stratechery calls it aggregation theory, it really leads to the dominant firm. They&#39;re all saying similar things and all the data that we&#39;ve seen in the two decades since Shapiro and Varian wrote the book seriously suggests they were right. Though if you think about it that probably shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise. Shapiro holds an economics chair at Berkeley and Varian is the chief economist for a small firm you might&#39;ve heard of called Google. So maybe these two guys were onto something. </p>\n<p>But it comes back to something we&#39;ve talked about in past episodes like <a href=\"http://www.timpeter.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aW1wZXRlci5jb20vMjAxNy8wMy8yOS9jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLWlzLXF1ZWVuLXdoYXQtZG9lcy10aGF0LW1lYW4tdGhpbmtzLW91dC1sb3VkLWVwaXNvZGUtMTkwLw%3D%3D&#038;feed-stats-url-post-id=7186\">&#8220;Customer Experience is Queen,&#8221;</a> that you must differentiate yourself &mdash; especially if you&#39;re not in a position to be the dominant firm. And when we think about the folks who are the dominant firms, what they&#39;re doing is providing that platform that says these are the trusted reviews, these are the people you can trust, to say yes you can buy through us to get the product or the service that you&#39;re looking for. And that&#39;s why people like Amazon and Apple and Etsy and Yelp and Airbnb and Uber and Expedia and all the rest have positioned themselves so well. Because customers know they can trust the reviews there and then they can buy through those channels. </p>\n<h3>What Digital Means for the Future of Brands &#8211; What You Can Do</h3>\n<p>For <em>you</em> to succeed you have to be the kind of place that people want to write reviews about. You have to differentiate yourself. You have to say why is it someone would choose you in the first place and why would they would choose to tell their friends and family and fans and followers on social. Because if you don&#39;t do that, you&#8217;ll fall into that gray area in the middle and let me tell you that gray area in the middle is not a good place to be. </p>\n<p>So when we think about the future of brands, when we think about the future of <em>your</em> brand, it really can come down to are you remarkable? Are you a brand worth telling others about? If you are, you&#8217;re going to be fine regardless of who the dominant firms are because customers will see that in the ratings and reviews that they see. They may buy the first time through a third-party, but you can convert them to a direct customer on a subsequent purchase. But if you&#39;re not they&#39;re going to choose you in the first place and that&#39;s going to put you in a very very ugly position. So I can&#39;t say for hundred percent sure that these these platforms, these trust proxies will kill <em>all</em> brands. But if you don&#39;t provide your customers with an experience that is truly remarkable and truly differentiated, it&#39;s a real safe bet that they will kill <em>yours</em>. </p>\n<h3>What Digital Means for the Future of Brands &#8211; Conclusion </h3>\n<p>Now looking at the clock on the wall we are out of time for this week.

The company teaches kids the basic of coding and robotics using LEGO compatible coding blocks.\n\nDanny says Algobrix is a real game changer as it creates a positive association to coding. Kids build a robot from building blocks and then build code using physical LEGO compatible coding blocks. Each block represents a logical command that allows the robot to move around, make sounds, and light up.\n\nAlgobrix recently did a Kickstarter a sucessful campaign over the summer becoming fully funded in 24 hours and raising over $1 Million during the two month time frame. Danny says crowdfunding allowed them to have the world judge their project.\n\nBefore joining Algobrix, Danny was teaching at Ben Gurion University and researched a variety of subjects in the field of robotics. Among his projects, he developed an innovative concept for robotic grasping and a 3D robotic game for upper limb rehabilitation.\n\nAlgobrix Indiegogo is available here and you can view the Kickstarter Page here.\n\nListen to the interview on Startup Radio on December 6, 2017 at 6pm.",

Her &#8220;why&#8221; is to change the culture of traditional CPA practices.<br />\nJody has written two books to help accountants create a better experience for their customers and employees. Her first book is The Radical CPA, and the second is From Success to Significance.<br />\n<br />\n* Email: <a href=\"mailto:jody@newvisioncpagroup.com\">jody@newvisioncpagroup.com</a><br />\n* Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jodypadarcpa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@jodypadarcpa</a><br />\n<br />\n10-Minute Transcript<br />\n[00:00:00] Welcome to the Art of Value Show, Jody Padar. Jody has been a CPA for 25 years. Her firm is called New Vision CPA Group. When I asked Jody to describe her firm she said there's two whys. The first is for their firm. They want to use technology to grow as close to their customers as possible. But her personal why is that she's out to change the culture of CPA firms. To that end she's written two books. The first one, The Radical CPA, and her second book to be published soon, From Success to Significance.<br />\n[00:00:36] When I asked Jodi something unique about herself, she said she's a bad TV junkie. Now you may wonder what that means. She likes to watch shows like the 90-Day Fiancée and Sister Wives. You can find her online at New Vision CPA dot com and the Radical CPA dot com. Jodi welcome to the show.<br />\n[00:00:55] Thank you.<br />\n[00:00:56] It's a pleasure to have you. We actually got to spend two and a half days together back in November at the Value Conference. So first thank you for attending but it was really fun just to get to hang out with you in some of your peers.<br />\n[00:01:10] It was a great event. It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot too actually.<br />\n[00:01:13] Well I appreciate that and we'll talk some more about that maybe later. But let's start where we always do what's the most important thing you can share about pricing.<br />\n[00:01:22] It's a process. So, I think everyone thinks you wake up one day and you know how to price. And I think I've been on this pricing journey for like 12 years now and I keep evolving to the next level. And one I think I kind of get it. I totally get like thrown off my rocker and I have to like kind of re-evaluate everything that I thought that I knew and start over.<br />\n[00:01:49] So you get to a point where you say OK here's a new concept we're going to implemented and then you get to a point where you're like OK now we've got to evolve that again. Do you have an example offhand that might demonstrate that?<br />\n[00:02:01] I think what happens is like your pricing evolves as you and your firm evolves and so that I don't think I realize because I think your brand is always evolving. And so, then what happens is this stuff that you used to accept as being a really good price. Three years ago is no longer the right price for your firm because your firm has evolved its set has evolved as well as you've evolved in what you understand the value to be.<br />\n[00:02:31] And so then you have to evolve everything around with that in a different way to say it is as you learn and grow as the leader of a business that influences your business which in turn you're going to be creating more value for the customer and as you're creating new types of value you're increasing the value that you do create your pricing has got to adjust accordingly.<br />\n[00:02:53] I don't think most people get that because we live in a fixed price world. Most people who price things think that pricing is the same and they don't realize the subjectivity of it and I think that's the hardest part to understand.<br />\n[00:03:07] Do you find that CPA and bookkeepers wrestle with the subjective component more than anything else that's always been my observation from the outside CPA or trained on numbers, debits and credits,",

Some people think that giving cold hard cash as a Christmas present is a bit of a faux pas. Luckily, we don't think that at all, so if you want to slip some money into our stocking you can do so at comedy.co.uk/pfs/donate (try not to picture us dancing for you in stockings as you do this).\n\nIf Xmas has left you stoney broke, fear not, we'd also love the gift of exposure (try not to picture us exposing ourselves as you read this). Help us spread the word about the show: gift it to a friend, secret-santa it to your entire following on social media... or why not make a loved one the offering of all the Flatslam in existence (just put the URL comedy.co.uk/pfs into a Christmas card - sure it'll look cheap, but they'll thank you for it eventually).\n\nLinks!\n\nCheck out Elis' rather spartan website - www.elisjames.co (which includes a link to his Radio X podcast with John Robins). And johnrobins.com/gigs has John's tour, which Elis plugs in the show.\n\nCheck out Andy's website - andyzaltzman.co.uk - and if you fancy going to see his London show (on till January 6th 2018) you can get tickets here: https://sohotheatre.com/shows/andy-zaltzman-2017-the-certifiable-history/\n\nFind out more about Martin 'Snow' White's brilliant band the Mystery Fax Machine Orchestra - and buy their new album at: https://mysteryfaxmachineorchestra.wordpress.com/\n\nWhile you're at it, please do also 'like' our Facebook page, follow Pappy's and Producer Ben on Twitter @pappystweet @_ben_walker and visit Pappy's Tumblr.",

In this episode of <em>Getting Work To Work</em>, we talk about how Dan got into comics, bad career advice for those looking to get into comics, favorite stories to tell, and his heroes.</p>\n<p><em>Several quotes from this episode:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I’ve been told that I draw like a writer…. All of the skills I’ve developed in art were motivated by my desire to tell better comic book stories, faster.”</li>\n<li>“My favorite stories to tell as an artist are stories about characters who have a position of strength, but are constantly being put on the back foot…. As a writer, I love telling mysteries. I love following a character as they earn pieces of information that they are eventually able to put together and unlock a secret, reveal a truth or something.”</li>\n<li>“I’m constantly seeking stories to tell that are more and more emotionally real. That’s the big quest right now.”</li>\n<li>“I don’t think that a story can resonate with an audience unless they can see themselves in it.”</li>\n<li>“If I’m ever stuck, if I ever feel like I’m overthinking things, I’ll pick up <em>Batman &amp; the Monster Men</em>…or I’ll pick up <em>Trinity</em> or <em>Grendel vs. The Shadow</em>. These [are] really excellent examples of how to tell a big story in an all protean kinda way.”</li>\n<li>“I needed to be able to talk about story in a very concise way so that people wouldn’t get bored and that people would get why I was interested in it.”</li>\n<li>“If you can’t find a joy in this, then your readers aren’t going to find that joy either.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Show Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://danschkade.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dan Schkade</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://helioscopepdx.com/main\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Helioscope</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Eisner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Will Eisner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Wagner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Matt Wagner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandman_Mystery_Theatre\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Sandman Mystery Theatre</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_and_the_Monster_Men\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Batman &amp; the Mystery Men</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman/Superman/Wonder_Woman:_Trinity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Grendel-vs-Shadow-Matt-Wagner/dp/1616556420\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Grendel vs. The Shadow</em></a> by Matt Wagner</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/San-Hannibal-City-Love-Fear/dp/0990568806\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>San Hannibal: The city of Love and Fear</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.deniskitchen.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Denis Kitchen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://theartofibrahimmoustafa.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ibrahim Moustafa</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C72513026279001011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>James Bond: Solstice</em></a> by Ibrahim Moustafa</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Ray_Palmer)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Atom (Dr. Ray Palmer)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/the-fix\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Fix</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sprouse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chris Sprouse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damion_Scott\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Damion Scott</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Sienkiewicz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bill Sienkiewicz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://suspiciousbehaviorproductions.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Invasion from Planet Wrestletopia</em></a> by Suspicious Behavior Productions</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://fantagraphics.com/flog/now-in-stock-penny-century-a-love-and-rockets-book-by-jaime-hernandez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Penny Century: A Love and Rockets Book</em></a> by Jaime Hernandez</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.fantagraphics.com/corpseontheimjin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Corpse on the Imjin!

I have worked for Cameron-Brooks for 18 years now and, as far as I know, there isn&#8217;t another professional out there meeting with JMOs considering a career transition with more time in the industry than me.  Yet, I still think I just started in this industry and have so much to learn. But even with that in mind, over the years, I have developed a few key JMO transition and career tips to help you on your path.</p>\n\n<p>In this podcast episode, Pete Van Epps interviews me about my background, Cameron-Brooks&#8217; experience and advice on making the transition, and succeeding in a business career.  While the interview lasts more than 30 minutes, my advice to transitioning officers or former military officers now working in business is pretty simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Humility.  If you are not humble, life will humble you anyway.  Take time to learn from others and find mentors.  Realize you ALWAYS have a lot to learn.</li>\n<li>Go hard.  If you have humility, drive, work ethic, and energy to reach excellence, you have a great foundation for success.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I believe the foundation of success is humility and the drive for excellence.  This podcast goes into more detail about how to do both.</p>\n<p>I have participated in over 90 Cameron-Brooks Career Conferences, helped more than 3,000 JMOs make the transition, mentored hundreds of our alumni, and I still have a lot to learn myself.  Yet, my advice to myself is the same as it is to you: stay humble and go hard so that you never think you have &#8220;arrived&#8221;, continuously seek to learn, and always look for ways to serve others and add value to your company.</p>\n<p>Joel Junker</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like more information about Cameron-Brooks, you can visit our website <a href=\"http://www.cameron-brooks.com/\">here</a> or pick up a copy of <em>PCS to Corporate America</em> by Roger Cameron <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PCS-Corporate-America-Military-Interviewing/dp/0940672855/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510849344&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pcs+to+corporate+america&amp;dpID=517FkUlFylL&amp;preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&amp;dpSrc=srch\">here</a>.</p>",

And contractors will be looking for work; there’s plenty of that to go around.  So, both homeowners and contractors will need reliable information and the warnings that go along with it; and agencies need info too.  Whether it’s a community hit by wildfires, or one that’s been devastated by severe weather or man-made catastrophes, new ways of targeted communication pop-up all the time; now it’s time for you to connect. And if you’re a contractor and you’re not licensed to do business in California you could face a citation for any work you solicit. The fact that there is an emergency declaration will enhance a misdemeanor which could send you to prison.<br />\nIn this episode, we talk with Rick Lopes, chief of public affairs for the Contractors State License Board in California.

This program helps physicians, nurses, and midwives learn to anticipate problems of childbirth. It is not just the mothers who are saved in Third World countries, since maternal deaths have been on the rise in the United States as well. Another Rotary-related group discussed is taking African women .sex workers, giving them sewing machines, and making them into entrepreneurs,  producing shirts that are sold at Rotary conventions. Although not a Rotary program per se., the Gift of Life, which supplies hope to children with heart disease through pediatric cardiology, also was represented at the Convention. For literacy, the program Books for Africa, provides donated books by the container load to nearly every nation in Africa.<br />\nLearn more:<br />\n<a href=\"https://calmedrotary.org/\">Rotary Action Group: Stop Mothers Dying</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://clubrunner.blob.core.windows.net/00000006774/en- ca/files/homepage/the-kwenuha-women-s-association-rotary-shirt/Rotary- Livingstone-Catalogue.pdf\">Rotary Shirts from Zambia</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.giftoflifeinternational.org/\">The Gift of Life</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.booksforafrica.org/\">Books for Africa</a></p>",

    "description_y": "<p>In this LITE episode, host Abigail Wright talks with retired FDA &amp; Pfizer staff member George Walden about the importance of friends, family, and activities, his views on the world today, and appreciating the differences in humanity. For more, visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://patreon.com/peaceofpersistence\">http://patreon.com/peaceofpersistence</a>&nbsp;to hear about his experiences with the FDA &amp; Pfizer, the value in a single life, George's key to happiness and much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bio/Intro:<br />George Walden was born in Washington DC and was raised in Upper Marlboro, MD. He and his two brothers and two sisters still get together for family gatherings a couple of times during the year.<br /><br />George completed a Bachelor of Science degree at Morgan State University in Baltimore in 1972. Following he graduation, he was hired by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in Newark, NJ and worked for the FDA for 25 1/2 years as a Consumer Safety Officer. He was fortunate to take an early retirement with the FDA in 1997 and begin a career with Warner Lambert (later known as Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) as a Corporate Quality Auditor.&nbsp; George worked for Warner Lambert/Pfizer, Inc. for 17 years and traveled to nearly 40 countries around the world. He retired from Pfizer in April 2015.<br /><br />Now he spends his time practicing Aikido, Yoga, playing golf, reading, and spending time with family and friends.<br /><br />Show summary:<br />I don't think we've ever talked about this, but I got my master's degree at the University of MD in College Park, so I'm very familiar with DC and Prince George's county. What was it like for you, growing up in that area?<br />He remembers a fun upbringing with what he needed as the second of five children. Both his parents worked until George was born, when his mother agreed to stay home and take care it and them. Communal family dinners played an important role in keeping his family together. Although the community was quiet, without much to do, the children all found ways to keep themselves busy with sports, sledding, go karts, and other activities with friends.<br /><br />It seems like growing up, in your jobs, and in the sports that you do, community is very important to you. How has that enhanced your life?<br />It's helped him see people differently, and as valuable. George tells us about experiences where he'd speak with people on the phone as part of his job helping other companies comply before meeting them in person. He might have a conversation where the person would complain about minorities or women or the government, and then meet the man in person. As the man met him and got to know him, he treated him incredibly kindly. \"There's a lot of hatred and fear and animosity in the world, but people are people... Once we learn a little bit about each other and get to know each other, we find out, we're all the same.\" He believes his community upbringing contributed to his perspective on that.<br /><br />What's your perspective on what's happening today in our culture? Between the current political climate, the extreme polarization of different viewpoints, and the recent resurgence of overt racism... is any of this new?<br />We discuss how it's not really new, but that now with the statements made by current leadership, people feel that they can express their extreme viewpoints.<br /><br />How have you reacted to it, and what do you think we can do better as individuals to help improve society in general?<br />Let people have their space. George goes back to his story about the people he met in the FDA. If you give people space to get to know each other beyond biases and appearances, there's really no reason for people to hate each other.<br /><br />What does happiness mean to you, in your life?<br />Happiness, for George means being able to do the things he wants to do, especially Aikido, golf, and being social and around people. His father's life consisted of work, the family, and the house. On forced vacations, he'd work on the house or visit family, or fish. When he retired, after a year or two, he had to go back to work. George believes you have to have something to keep you going.<br /><br />Have you always been a pretty content person, or have you had to work at it?<br />George has been pretty content most of his life because he's always done things that keep him interested.<br /><br />If there were one thing you'd like the world to see differently, what would it be?<br />More respect and more acceptance of each other. Everyone doesn't have to be the same, and that makes the world interesting.<br /><br />Thanks for listening!

    "description_y": "Every parent wishes to have a happy, healthy child. Sadly we know that wish doesn’t always come true. Children with serious or life-threatening medical conditions often require specialized, comprehensive care. The mantra for anyone who works in the field of pediatric healthcare is, ‘Children are not little adults.’ Seriously ill children have a vast majority of special needs, including the size of the medical equipment, types of supplies, and extra care from a variety of providers. The old-fashioned fee-for service model does not fit with the level of holistic care that is required to help these children return to or maintain health.  Welcome to STEPS to Value, a podcast that explores the intersection of people, processes & technology in healthcare as the industry moves towards a value-focused model. In today’s episode we will talk with Brenda Wolf, President and CEO of La Rabida Children’s Hospital.  In this episode we will talk to Brenda Wolf, President and CEO of La Rabida Children’s Hospital about how the hospital has become a ‘medical hub’ to ensure that children and their families receive all of the physical, emotional and educational support they need, not just during a doctor’s visit but throughout their young lives.  This Episode’s Guest:Brenda Wolf President and CEOLa Rabida Children's HospitalFind out more about La Rabida Children's HospitalFollow Brenda on Twitter: @bjwsfhs",

podcast interview, partly about his latest book, <a title= \"The Seventh Sense\" href= \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316285064/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=paletrea-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0316285064&linkId=eb567274f840f75154716b450d607b13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Seventh Sense</a> and partly about his overall life and pursuit of excellence.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Mr. Ramo started off as a journalist, working at Newsweek then for Time Inc back when, as he says, “it mattered who The Man of the Year was.”  He worked as both senior and as foreign editor at Time, and he wrote for them long enough ago (1997) that he wrote The Man Of the Year cover story on Andy Grove, one of the founders of Intel.</p> <p class=\"p1\">From Time Inc he moved to China to pursue adventure in the world of business.  He became fluent in Chinese and fell in love with the culture.</p> <p class=\"p1\">In China he worked for the former president of Goldman Sachs and eventually began working at his current company, Kissinger Associates, where he’s now co-CEO.</p> <p class=\"p1\">He lived in Beijing full time for a little over a decade and now splits his time between Beijing and New York.  Yes, he’s a busy, pipe hittin’ dude and I was super stoked to connect for this conversation.</p> <p class=\"p1\">I found him through his first book, <a title= \"No Visible Horizon\" href= \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743257901/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=paletrea-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0743257901&linkId=1878ff34c68a4a71932f5314dd79ff3e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">No Visible Horizo</a>n, a lovely story about his journey to aerobatic nationals as a pilot that reminded me of reading Ernest Gann’s “<a title= \"Fate Is The Hunter\" href= \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671636030/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=paletrea-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0671636030&linkId=8577cc73539a79fb50e77ca2e4bca6d5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fate Is The Hunter</a>”, another excellent and relatively unsung pilot book.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Curious about what else he’d written, I found his third book, <a title=\"The Seventh Sense\" href= \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316285064/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=paletrea-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0316285064&linkId=2a639f9b9aeb8c4a59aff8124f423c75\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Seventh Sense</a>, which I read through with great enjoyment and then went on to read his second book, <a title=\"The Age of the Unthinkable\" href= \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316118117/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=paletrea-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0316118117&linkId=fce9898b540f41159c8abc02a4efc399\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Age of the Unthinkable.</a> </p> <p class=\"p1\">Reading those two books gave me a look into the mind of a writer deeply immersed in international relations, intensely curious about connections in the modern age, and fascinated with networks in particular.  </p> <p class=\"p1\">Both books deal with the unpredictable nature of an increasingly connected world, and as a business owner running a small enterprise in that world I found them entertaining and educational.  In fact, they forced me to re-evaluate our strategy at Paleo Treats and the way we’re using our networks.</p> <p class=\"p1\">In this interview we dive into the important points of a network, the difference between complex and complicated systems, what topology is and why it matters, and how emergent properties of networks are inevitable.</p> <p class=\"p1\">I asked him how he curates and uses his curiosity, and he talked about his main theme in <a title= \"The Seventh Sense\" href= \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316285064/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=paletrea-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0316285064&linkId=49668db80e00511a04e3bf91db7985f1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Seventh Sense</a> that “connection changes the nature of an object.”</p> <p class=\"p1\">We do dive briefly into some flying stuff and how flying may move from unnatural to natural as you become a better pilot, but the majority of this interview deals with networks and how to understand and explore them in this incredibly connected world.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Joshua talks about the importance of figuring out what tools you need in order to understand and investigate a problem.  He places the conversation in the context of historical cycles, the enduring nature of art, and the best kind of adventure you can have.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Enjoy the show!</p> <p class=\"p1\">Books Mentioned</p> <p class=\"p1\">-<a title=\"No Visible Horizon\"

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Rational Optimist</a></p> <p class=\"p1\">For each podcast I do I end up writing a bunch of notes and questions.  While I don’t always ask the questions, it’s helpful to have them written down and reviewed before the show.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Here are my notes for this interview:</p> <p class=\"p1\">-You’re a searcher, a seeker, and a story teller.  Tell me about that.</p> <p class=\"p1\">-in Age if the Unthinkable you talk about the importance of relationships.  You seem very well connected to a number of different cohorts.  How did your learning of Chinese culture influence that?  Is there anything more important than building relationships when it comes to getting things done? (Planning to be Dan Kaminsky)</p> <p class=\"p1\">-connection changes the nature of an object.  What does that mean?</p> <p class=\"p1\">-how are the fourth revolution & the seventh sense tied together?</p> <p class=\"p1\">-how do we cultivate the 7th sense? </p> <p class=\"p1\">-Clausewitz noted, “Many intelligence reports in war are contradictory; even more are false, and most are uncertain. . . . In short, most intelligence is false.”  How are you assessing a network accurately?</p> <p class=\"p1\">-in Age of the Unthinkable you talk about the spymaster Farkash asking questions no one else asked and being amazed that Israel’s actions had forced the enemy to evolve.  This evolution of both sides seems like a fundamental part of struggle.  Is anyone asking “How do we force our enemy to *devolve*?”  Examples of it working?</p> <p class=\"p1\">-how many languages do you speak or you speak or understand?  Is it worth it to learn another language, or is there a universal language of networks?</p> <p class=\"p1\">The standard visualization of a network is as a fish net, however, that is not what it might look like. When you talk about topology there is a deceptive notion that these things can be understood in nearly 3 dimensions. How else can someone visualize what a network might physically look like? Or does this require a new skill of four dimensional visualization?</p> <p class=\"p1\">-can you talk a little about how blockchain ties together multiple networks (financial, legal, social?)</p> <p class=\"p1\">-do we need to change to a network system without fallible leaders?  Our current leaders seem unable to solve problems for which there are fairly clear solutions.</p> <p class=\"p1\">-how would you befriend a network?  Can you be friends with a network?</p> <p class=\"p1\">-how would you addict a network? </p> <p class=\"p1\">-assessing trust in a network? </p> <p class=\"p1\">-assessing quality of expertise in the network?  use past predictions? </p> <p class=\"p1\">-let’s talk about topology & networks.  As I understand it, topology basically refers to the way networks can be thought of in terms of connection time between nodes, regardless of physical distance.  If topology is 2 dimensional, is there a way to understand how a 3rd dimension would apply?</p> <p class=\"p1\">-how can we find the edge of a network so we can “shake the blanket” and cause change?  Is it possible?</p> <p class=\"p1\">-a group of almost successful (or even unsuccessful) people is far more powerful than a single lucky person; do networks remove the filter of luck, or offset the capriciousness of chance?</p> <p class=\"p1\">-how does a small business use the seventh sense?  practical example?</p> <p class=\"p1\">BACKGROUND</p> <p class=\"p1\">Dad is a cardiologist being outdated/outgunned by Google search</p> <p class=\"p1\">Mom is a high powered lawyer who wrote about the power of systems (specifically applied to law offices)</p> <p class=\"p1\">-aerobatic pilot, No Visible Horizon</p> <p class=\"p1\">-started as a journalist, a story teller in ’93 at Newsweek</p> <p class=\"p1\">-Time magazine in ’96, hired by Walter Isaacson, the guy who wrote biographies about Steve Jobs, Ben Franklin, Albert Einstein, and Henry Kissinger</p> <p class=\"p1\">-oversaw Time’s digital operations while covering tech;

We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>\n<p>15 (John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, ‘This is the one I spoke about when I said, “He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.”’) 16 Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given. 17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and[b] is in the closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.</p>",

    "description_y": "I am excited to share this conversation with Dan Signorini, a.k.a. Nitewolf9 on MTGTheSource. Dan and David Gearhart created the “Team America” deck, which started off as an elaborate joke and has evolved into the BUG / Grixis Delver decks of today. Chance are, if you have ever played or played against a Delver deck, you have been influenced by Dan’s deck building choices.\n\nDan is a long-standing member of the North Virginia Legacy community, which includes players such as Alix Hatfield, Jesse Hatfield, Anwar Ahmed, David Gearhart, David Price, Damon Whitby, and many others. Together, the group has developed influential decks such as Canadian Threshold, Solidarity, Dredge, Zoo, and (of course!) Team America. Dan was also one of Bob Huang’s early mentors. Bob has, in turn, popularized the de facto Grixis Delver build that we know so well today. It is no exaggeration to say that Dan and his group have been instrumental to the development of the Legacy format, and “Type 1.5” before that.\n\nFurthermore, Dan has had a strong influence on *me*. When I started playing competitive Magic almost ten years ago, he was the person I learned from. Dan was the one to offer me advice on how to play the “Team America” deck and matchup tips. I would not be creating content today, or playing Magic at all, without his kindness and support.\n\nFor these reasons, this episode is very special to me. In true “Humans of Magic” fashion, the discussion touches on everything Dan cares about – family, community, music, martial arts, competitive mindset, and more. Dan speaks openly about a wide variety of topics, and I hope that you enjoy listening to it.\n\nTime stamps:\n\n[03:17] Introduction\n[09:28] Eternal Weekend\n[13:58] Dan’s day job\n[16:57] Childhood and family background\n[29:33] Dan’s best friend in high school\n[33:20] Learning martial arts\n[39:48] Diffusing conflict\n[44:08] Being curious about life\n[46:02] First Magic experience\n[48:18] The North Virginia Magic crew\n[54:52] On being open-minded\n[56:30] From Suicide Black to Team America\n[1:05:00] Curio Cavern\n[1:07:26] Thoughts on the current Legacy format \n[1:13:03] The ban of Sensei’s Divining Top – correct?\n[1:16:25] Ban Deathrite Shaman?\n[1:18:56] Ban Delver of Secrets?\n[1:21:21] More thoughts on Legacy\n[1:29:37] On playing well in high-level competition\n[1:32:50] How Dan has helped other players develop\n[1:34:35] What Dan’s learned from the community\n[1:36:14] Goals\n[1:37:05] Things Dan would tell himself, if he could go back five years\n[1:39:22] On happiness\n[1:41:26] Things that piss Dan off\n[1:46:22] Tips for new competitive players",

David and I break down some of his key percentages from this season and compare them to the rest of his career.\n\nDoes Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin deserve to be considered a Coach of the year candidate? We discuss that topic briefly.\n\nIs Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green the biggest offensive threat to the Steelers Monday night? We discuss his key matchup ahead of the game.\n\nAs usual, we close out our Friday show by picking all the remaining NFL games on the week 13 schedule against the spread and that includes us having a difference of opinion on the outcome of the Steelers-Bengals game.\n\nAs always, several other smaller talking points are mixed in throughout the show that are not highlighted here in this post.\n\nThanks for listening and don't forget to call or email with questions or comments and please pass us along to your friends!\n\nThe new message hotline is (814) 429-YINZ",

    "description_y": "​Welcome to the new, relaunched, Bearded Gentlemen Music podcast… now called “The 1st of the Month Music Podcast”. The new format will be Jon and I looking over what happened in the prior month and basically talking about things we like and didn’​​t like. You can look for the pod to drop on the first of every month, unless if the first is on a weekend I guess. If it’s on a weekend it will either come out on the Monday after or the Friday before. Or maybe both. Or maybe neither. Who’s to say, really?<br />\nI’m to say this month, because the 1st of the Month Music Podcast isn’t coming out on the 1st of the month…<br />\nnor does it really follow the format that we normally follow. Partially because we are lazy…<br />\n… but partially because we wanted to talk Christmas music. Tis&#8217; the season, right? And let’s be straight up, Christmas songs can be straight bangers. We recap all the Christmas songs we love and hate, but it seems like we mostly talk about the stuff we hate and get off onto weird tangents. We also definitely discover Jon doesn’t really know or like Christmas music like he claimed to. He came in reppin like he liked Christmas music, and it turns out he just has an Elvis Christmas CD and a Bob Dylan Christmas CD that he doesn’t even like.<br />\nAlso, please subscribe to our podcast and rate it appropriately on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/bearded-gentlemen-music-podcast/id1066051815?mt=2#episodeGuid=http%3A%2F%2Fbeardedgentlemenmusic.com%2F%3Fp%3D30242\">iTunes</a> / <a href=\"http://www.subscribeonandroid.com/beardedgentlemenmusic.com/feed/podcast/\">Google Play</a> / <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/bearded-gentlemen-music/bgm-pod?refid=stpr\">Stitcher</a> and where ever else podcasts are found.

And I am very much looking forward to sharing all things social work research with you!\n\nI decided to begin a podcast about Social Work Research, as I was keen to find out more about all the great social work projects out there in our communities, as well as find out how social work research actually works and what makes it social workyâ€¦\n\nEach episode I interview a social work researcher and ask them a few questions about a social work research project theyâ€™ve undertaken. Hopefully over the course of a few episodes we can begin to paint a picture of what social work research is and how it makes a difference!\n\nGo to swdiscoveries.com for more info.",

My gift to see into your Soul and Brand it. I donâ€™t have a heart-breaking life story. I had the BEST upbringing, spoilt with love and attention. Was given freedom to express myself and be me. I drove myself a little crazy always trying to live by the rules when I really wanted to break them. My story is that Iâ€™ve gone through lifeâ€™s â€œgrowthâ€ lessons to learn more and more about Consumer Behaviourism â€“ Buyer Behaviour and the Art and Discipline of Spiritual Brand Marketing. And my Ego will confirm â€“ Iâ€™m good at this. Which is why I do what I do with an unquenchable passion. Join Sashkaâ€™s Facebook community here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/brandsashka/",

    "description_x": "Established in 1995\nThe Muslim Community Radio is a multicultural and multilingual Islamic radio station. It broadcasts to the Sydney community in general while incorporating elements that target the Islamic community of Sydney. It first transmitted twenty-four hours a day during the month of Ramadan of 1995 and has continued to broadcast during every month of Ramadan and Dhul-hijja (Pilgrimage month). In addition, in 1997 Muslim Community Radio was broadcasting on every Friday of that year until the introduction of the temporary broadcast community license (TBCL). Muslim Community Radio currently broadcasts 24 hours 365 days a year covering all Islamic events. Because Arabic/Lebanese is, according to statistics, the major ethnic language communicated among the Muslims in Sydney, understandably the radio programs are primarily transmitted in the Arabic and English languages with spots of other community languages, evolving in pace with demand.",

WAMC's Friday quiz segment, Any Questions? , puts news director Ian Pickus in the hot seat, as he and listeners field questions from resident quizzer Mike Nothnagel. Nothnagel is Associate Professor of mathematics at The Culinary Institute of America, and a crossword constructor for the New York Times and Games Magazine , among other outlets. Often, Mike and Ian switch seats or feature guest answerers, such as Will Shortz, Liane Hansen, John Flansburgh and Mike Doughty. Any Questions? airs Friday during Northeast Report Late Edition on WAMC. Last week's challenge: Start with the word VOLKSWAGEN. Change one letter to a G and you can spell two five-letter words (one singular, one plural) for things you might see in a courtroom. What are they? Answer : If you change the K to a G, you can spell GAVEL and GOWNS.
